JOL	front	intro	aq5w			0		# Introduction to Joel<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Joel<br><br>1. The land ruined; the day of Yahweh is coming (1:1–2:11)<br>- Locusts and drought (1:1–20)<br>- The day of Yahweh (2:1–11)<br>1. Yahweh restores his people (2:12-32)<br>- The people should turn to Yahweh, for he will pity them (2:12–27)<br>- The Spirit of Yahweh, wonders, and salvation (2:28–32)<br>1. Yahweh will judge the nations (3:1-21)<br>- Yahweh judges the nations (3:1–16)<br>- Yahweh dwells in Zion (3:17–21)<br><br>### What is the Book of Joel about?<br><br>The main idea in the Book of Joel is “the day of Yahweh.” This expression is found five times (1:15, 2:1, 2:11, 2:21, 3:14).<br><br>The people of Israel looked forward to “the day of Yahweh” as a day that Yahweh would judge the nations around them. But Joel warns that Yahweh would also judge Israel for being unfaithful to him. After judging them, Yahweh will restore his people.<br><br>Joel’s message applies to the people of God in the church age. For Yahweh says, “I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh” and “everyone who calls on Yahweh will be saved” (2:28 and 2:32, quoted by Peter in Acts 2:17 and 2:21).<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>The traditional title of this book is “The Book of Joel” or just “Joel.” Translators may also call it the “The Book about Joel” or “The Sayings of Joel.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Joel?<br><br>This book contains the prophecies of an Israelite named Joel, son of Pethuel. The book does not tell when Joel prophesied.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the meaning of the locust attacks in Joel 1 and 2, and of the drought in Joel 2?<br><br>Locust attacks occurred often in the ancient Near East. Certain kinds of grasshoppers would come in countless numbers. There would be so many that they would darken the sky like a black cloud that blocked the sunlight. They often came after a long period of no rain. They came down on whatever crops were surviving in the fields and stripped them bare of their leaves. The locusts could not be stopped and caused terrible damage. For this reason, locust attacks served as a powerful image of military attacks in the Old Testament. In Chapters 1 and 2, Joel described locust attacks using military terms. He may have been speaking of enemy invaders coming and destroying the land its people.<br><br>There are various names for locusts in the original language of the Old Testament. It is uncertain whether these refer to different kinds of locusts or to the same kind of locust in different stages of growth. For this reason, versions of the Bible differ in how they translate these terms.<br><br>Joel also described a drought in Chapter 2. It might have been a real lack of rain. Or Joel may have been speaking of either enemy invaders or Yahweh himself coming to punish his people and the other nations.<br><br>Translators should simply translate the locust attacks and drought as Joel described them and not worry about the various possible meanings.<br><br>### What did Joel prophesy about the future for God’s people?<br><br>Joel prophesied that God will defeat Israel’s enemies, rebuild the city of Jerusalem, and rule as victorious king over the whole world. At the same time, God will give his Spirit to all his people, and they will receive messages from him in dreams and visions. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How should one translate the poetry of the Book of Joel?<br><br>All of the text in the Book of Joel is poetry. The ULT presents it in this way. The UST, however, presents the text as prose. Translators may choose to use prose in their versions. Translators who want to translate the book as poetry should read about poetry and parallelism. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
JOL	1	intro	q2ev			0		# Joel 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Joel is written in poetic form and with striking imagery. The ULT is written in poetic form, but the UST has been transferred to a prose form. If possible, use the poetic form to communicate the meaning of this book in order to stay closer to the original meaning of the text.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Locusts<br>This book starts very dramatically with the imagery of the locusts and the devastation they produce. There are five different kinds of locusts that appear to come and they progressively destroy the vegetation including the crops, vineyards and even the trees of the whole land of Israel.<br><br>It was common for farmers in the ancient Near East to experience large locust swarms that would come and eat all crops in their fields. Joel might be describing such attacks in this first chapter. Because Joel uses military terms and images to describe these locust attacks, his descriptions might represent enemy invaders who would come and destroy the land its people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>Translators should translate simply, presenting the scenes of locusts as Joel describes them, and not worry about the various possible meanings.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical Questions<br>The author also uses rhetorical questions that communicate surprise and alarm. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
