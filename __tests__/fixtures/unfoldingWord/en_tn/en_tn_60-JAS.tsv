Closing exhortations<br>- Oaths (5:12)<br>- Prayer and healing (5:13-18)<br>- Care for one another (5:19-20)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of James?<br><br>The author identifies himself as James. This was probably James, the half-brother of Jesus. James was a leader in the early church and was part of the Jerusalem council. The Apostle Paul also called him a “pillar” of the church.<br><br>This is not the same man as the Apostle James. The Apostle James was killed before this letter was written.<br><br>### What is the Book of James about?<br><br>In this letter, James encouraged believers who were suffering. He told them know that God uses their suffering to help them become mature Christians. James also told them of the need for believers to do good deeds. He wrote much in this letter about how believers should live and treat one another. For example, he commanded them to treat one another fairly, to not fight with one another, and to use riches wisely.<br><br>James taught his readers by using many examples from nature such as in 1:6, 11 and 3:1-12. Also, many parts of this letter are similar to what Jesus wrote in the Sermon on the Mount (Mat 5-7).<br><br>### Who were the “twelve tribes in the dispersion”?<br><br>James said he was writing to the “twelve tribes in the dispersion” (1:1). Some scholars think that James was writing to Jewish Christians. Other scholars think that James was writing to all Christians in general. This letter is known as one of the “General Epistles” since it was not written to a specific church or individual.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “James.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “A Letter from James” or “The Letter James Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Did James disagree with Paul about how a person is justified before God?<br><br>Paul taught in Romans that Christians are justified by faith and not by works. James seems to teach that Christians are justified by works. This can be confusing. But a better understanding of what Paul and James taught shows that they agree with one another. Both of them taught that a person needs faith in order to be justified. And they both taught that true faith will cause a person to do good works. Paul and James taught about these things in different ways because they had different audiences who needed to know different things about being justified. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/works]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How should the translator signal transitions between topics in the Book of James?<br><br>The letter quickly changes topics. Sometimes James does not tell the readers that he is about to change topics. It is acceptable to allow the verses to appear disconnected from each other. It may make sense to set the passages apart by starting a new line or putting a space between topics.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of James?<br><br>* “Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is useless?” (2:20). The ULT, UST, and modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, “Do you want to know, foolish man, that faith without works is dead?” If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JAS	1	intro	pz2q			0		# James 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>James formally introduces this letter in verse 1. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Testing and temptation<br><br>These two words occur together in ([James 1:12-13](./12.md)). Both words speak of a person who is able to choose between doing something good and doing something evil. The difference between them is important. God is testing the person and wants him to do what is good. Satan is tempting the person and wants him to do what is evil.<br><br>### Crowns<br><br>The crown that a man who passes the test receives is a reward, something that people who do something especially good receive. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/reward]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphors<br><br>James uses many metaphors in this chapter, and you will need to understand the material on the metaphor page before you can translate them well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “To the twelve tribes in the dispersion”<br><br>It is not clear to whom James wrote this letter. He calls himself a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ, so he was probably writing to Christians. But he calls his readers “the twelve tribes in the dispersion,” words which usually refer to Jews. It is possible that he is using the words as a metaphor for “all people whom God has chosen” or that he wrote the letter at a time when most Christians had grown up as Jews.

JAS	2	intro	f5zd			0		# James 02 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Favoritism<br><br>Some of James’s readers treated rich and powerful people well and treated poor people badly. This is called favoritism, and James tells them that this is wrong. God wants his people to treat both rich people and poor people well.<br><br>### Justification<br><br>Justification is what happens when God makes a person righteous. James says here that God makes righteous or justifies people who do good works along with having faith. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Quotation marks<br><br>The words “Show me your faith without works, and I will show you my faith by my works” are hard to understand. Some people think that they are what “someone may say,” like the words in the quotation marks. Most versions translate them as words that James is saying back to that “someone.”<br><br>### “You have…I have”<br><br>Some people think that the words “you” and “I” are metonyms for “some people” and “other people.” If they are correct, verse 18 could be translated, “Someone may say, ‘Some people have faith and other people have works. Not everyone has both.’” If the next sentence is also what “someone may say,” it could be translated “Some people show their faith without works, and other people show their faith by their works. Both have faith.” In both cases, the reader will understand only if you add the extra sentence. It is probably best to translate as the ULT does.
