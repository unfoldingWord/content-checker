# Holy One

## Definition:

The term “Holy One” is a title in the Bible that almost always refers to God.

* In the Old Testament, this title often occurs in the phrase “Holy One of Israel.”
* In the New Testament, Jesus is also referred to as the “Holy One.”
* The term “holy one” is sometimes used in the Bible to refer to an angel.

## Translation Suggestions:

* The literal term is “the Holy” (with “One” being implied.) Many languages (like English) will translate this with the implied noun included (such as “One” or “God”).
* This term could also be translated as “God, who is holy” or “the Set Apart One.”
* The phrase “the Holy One of Israel” could be translated as “the Holy God whom Israel worships” or “the Holy One who rules Israel.”
* It is best to translate this term using the same word or phrase that is used to translate “holy.”
