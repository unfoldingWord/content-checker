# trespass

## Definition:

The term “trespass” means to cross a line or to violate a boundary. This term is often used figuratively, meaning to break a law or to violate the rights of another person.

* This term is very similar to the word "transgression," but is generally used more often to describe violations against other people than against God.
* A trespass can be a violation of a moral law or a civil law.
* A trespass can also be a sin committed against another person.
* This term is related to the terms “sin” and “transgress,” especially as it relates to disobeying God. All sins are trespasses against God.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Depending on the context, to “trespass against” could be translated as to “sin against” or to “break the rule.”
* Some languages may have an expression like “cross the line” that could be used to translate “trespass.”
* Consider how this term fits with the meaning of the surrounding Bible text and compare it to other terms that have a similar meaning, such as “transgress” and “sin.”
