# sign, proof, reminder

## Definition:

The term "sign" usually refers an object, event, or action that communicates a special meaning. 

* In the Bible, signs are sometimes given in connection to a promise or covenant that God has made:
    * The book of Genesis describes the rainbow God created in the sky as a sign (or reminder) to himself that he has promised he will never again destroy all life with a worldwide flood.
    * In the book of Genesis, God commanded the Israelites to circumcise their sons as a sign (or indicator) of the fact that he had made his covenant with them.

* Signs can reveal or point to something:
    * The book of Luke describes that an angel gave shepherds a sign that would help them know which baby in Bethlehem was the newborn Messiah.
    * Judas kissed Jesus as a sign to the religious leaders that Jesus was the one they should arrest.

* Signs can prove that something is true:
    * The book of Acts describes the miracles performed by the prophets and apostles as signs that proved they were speaking God’s message.
    * The book of John describes the miracles that Jesus performed as signs that proved he was truly the Messiah.

## Translation Suggestions:

* The frequent expression “signs and wonders” could be translated as “proofs and miracles” or “miraculous works that prove God’s power” or “amazing miracles that show how great God is.”
* Depending on its context, “sign” could also be translated as “signal” or “symbol” or “mark” or “evidence” or “proof” or “gesture.”
* To “make signs with the hands” could also be translated as “motion with the hands” or “gesture with the hands” or “make gestures.”
* In some languages, there may be one word for a “sign” that proves something and a different word for a “sign” that is a miracle.
