# Pilate

## Facts:

Pilate was the governor of the Roman province of Judea who sentenced Jesus to death.

* Because Pilate was the governor, he had the authority to put criminals to death.
* The Jewish religious leaders wanted Pilate to crucify Jesus, so they lied and said that Jesus was a criminal.
* Pilate realized that Jesus was not guilty, but he was afraid of the crowd and wanted to please them, so he ordered his soldiers to crucify Jesus.
