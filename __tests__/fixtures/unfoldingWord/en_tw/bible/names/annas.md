# Annas

## Facts:

Annas was the Jewish high priest in Jerusalem for 10 years, from approximately AD 6 to AD 15. Then he was removed from the high priesthood by the Roman government, although he continued to be an influential leader among the Jews.

* Annas was father-in-law to Caiaphas, the official high priest during the ministry of Jesus. 
* When Jesus was being arrested, Annas’s son-in-law Caiaphas was the official high priest. Annas is also mentioned as a high priest, however, because he was a former high priest who still had power and authority over the people.
* During his trial before the Jewish leaders, Jesus was first brought to Annas for questioning.
