# asleep, fall asleep, sleep, sleeper, sleepless

## Definition:

These terms can have figurative meanings relating to death.

* To “sleep” or “be asleep” can be a metaphor meaning to “be dead.” (See: Metaphor)
* The expression “fall asleep” means start sleeping, or, figuratively, die.
* To “sleep with one’s fathers” means to die, as one’s ancestors have, or to be dead, as one’s ancestors are.

## Translation Suggestions:

* To “fall asleep” could be translated as to “suddenly become asleep” or to “start sleeping” or to “die,” depending on its meaning.
* Note: It is especially important to keep the figurative expression in contexts where the audience did not understand the meaning. For example, when Jesus told his disciples that Lazarus was “sleeping” they thought he meant that Lazarus was just sleeping naturally. In this context, it would not make sense to translate this as “he died.”
* Some project languages may have a different expression for death or dying which could be used if the expressions “sleep” and “asleep” do not make sense.
