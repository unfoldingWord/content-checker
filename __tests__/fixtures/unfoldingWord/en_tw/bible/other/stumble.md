# stumble, reeling

## Definition:

The term “stumble” means “almost fall” when walking or running. Usually it involves tripping over something.

* Figuratively, to “stumble” can mean to “sin” or to “falter” in believing.
* This term can also refer to faltering or showing weakness when fighting a battle or when being persecuted or punished.

## Translation Suggestions

* In contexts where the term “stumble” means to physically trip over something, it should be translated with a term that means “almost fall” or “trip over.”
* This literal meaning could also be used in a figurative context, if it communicates the correct meaning in that context.
* For figurative uses where the literal meaning would not make sense in the project language, “stumble” could be translated as, “sin” or “falter” or “stop believing” or “become weak,” depending on the context.
* Another way to translate this term could be, “stumble by sinning” or “stumble by not believing.”
* The phrase “made to stumble” could be translated as “caused to become weak” or “caused to falter.”
