The terms “tenth” and “tithe” refer to “ten percent” or “one-out-of-ten portion” of one’s money, crops, livestock, or other possessions, which is given to God.

* In the Old Testament, God instructed the Israelites to set aside a tenth of their belongings to give as an offering of thanksgiving to him.
* This offering was used to support the Levite tribe of Israel who served the Israelites as priests and caretakers of the tabernacle and later, the temple.
* In the New Testament, God does not require giving a tithe, but instead he instructs believers to generously and cheerfully help people in need and support the work of Christian ministry.
* This could also be translated as “one-tenth” or “one out of ten.”
