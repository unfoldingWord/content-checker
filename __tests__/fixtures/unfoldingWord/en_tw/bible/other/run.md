# run, runner, rushed, quickly went, scattered, flows

## Definition:

Literally the term “run” means “move very quickly on foot,” usually at a greater speed than can be accomplished by walking.

This main meaning of “run” is also used in figurative expressions such as the following:
*     To “run in such a way as to win the prize”– refers to persevering in doing God’s will with the same perseverance as running a race in order to win.
*     To “run in the path of your commands” – means to gladly and quickly obey God’s commands.
*     To “run after other gods” means to persist in worshiping other gods.
*     “I run to you to hide me”  means to quickly turn to God for refuge and safety when faced with difficult things.
*     Water and other liquids such as tears, blood, sweat, and rivers are said to “run.” This could also be translated as, “flow.”
    The border of a country or region is said to “run along” a river or the border of a different country. This could be translated by saying that the country’s border “is next to” the river or other country or by saying that the country “borders” the river or other country.”
*     Rivers and streams can “run dry,” which means that they no longer have water in them. This could be translated as “have dried up” or “have become dry.”
*     The days of a feast can “run their course,” which means they “have passed by” or “are finished” or “are over.”*
