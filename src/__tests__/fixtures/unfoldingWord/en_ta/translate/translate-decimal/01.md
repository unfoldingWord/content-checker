### Description

The decimal point, or decimal comma, is a mark placed to the left of a number to show that the number refers to part of a whole number. For example .1 meter is not a whole meter but is only one tenth of a meter and .5 meter is not five meters, but is only five tenths of a meter. 3.7 meters is three and seven tenths of a meter. Numbers like these are used in the unfoldingWord® Simplified Text (UST).

In some countries people use a decimal point, and in other countries people use a decimal comma. So translators in countries that use a decimal comma would write “3.7 meters” as “3,7 meters.” In some cultures people prefer fractions. (See [Fractions](../translate-fraction/01.md).)

In the UST, parts of a number are written as decimals or fractions. When they are used with a measurement such as meters, grams, and liters, the are usually written as decimals.

#### Decimal Numbers in the UST

| Decimal | Fraction  | Simpler Fraction  |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
|.1 |one tenth |  |
|.2 |two tenths | one fifth |
|.3 |three tenths |  |
|.4 |four tenths | two fifths|
|.5 |five tenths | one half |
|.6 |six tenths | three fifths |
|.7 |seven tenths |   |
|.8 |eight tenths | four fifths |
|.9 |nine tenths |  |
|.25 |twenty-five one hundredths | one fourth |
|.75 |seventy-five one hundredths | three fourths |


#### Reasons this is a translation issue

* If translators want to use the measures in the UST, they will need to be able to understand the decimal numbers that are used with them.
* Translators will need to write the numbers in a way that their readers will understand them.

### Examples from the Bible

For telling about parts of a number, the unfoldingWord® Literal Text (ULT) uses fractions, and the UST uses mostly decimals when the number is used with a measurement. Another difference between the ULT and the UST is that when measuring [Biblical Distance](../translate-bdistance/01.md), [Biblical Weight](../translate-bweight/01.md), and [Biblical Volume](../translate-bvolume/01.md), they use different systems, so the numbers in the ULT and the UST are not the same for these measures.

> They are to make an ark of acacia wood. Its length must be **two and a half cubits**; its width will be **one cubit and a half**; and its height will be **one cubit and a half**. (Exodus 25:10 ULT)

The ULT uses the fraction “half.” This can also be written as the decimal “.5.”

> Tell the people to make a sacred chest from acacia wood. It is to be **one meter** long, **0.7 meter wide**, and **0.7 meter** high. (Exodus 25:10 UST)

The UST uses the decimal 0.7. This equals seven tenths.

Two and a half cubits is about one meter.

One and a half cubits is about .7 meter or seven tenths of a meter.

### Translation Strategies

* Decide whether you want to use only fractions, only decimals, or a combination of the two.
* Decide whether you want to use the measures given in the ULT or the UST or some other kind of measures.
* If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the ULT, simply translate the numbers and measures in the  ULT.
* If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the UST, simply translate the numbers and measures in the UST.

1. If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the ULT, you will need to change the fractions in the ULT to decimals.
1. If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the UST, you will need to change the decimals in the UST to fractions.

### Examples of Translation Strategies Applied

(1) If you decide to use decimals and the measures in the ULT, you will need to change the fractions in the ULT to decimals.

> **three tenths of an ephah** of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and **one log** of oil. (Leviticus 14:10 ULT)  
>> “**0.3 ephah** of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and **one log** of oil.”

(2) If you decide to use fractions and the measures in the UST, you will need to change the decimals in the UST to fractions.

> **about 6.5 liters** of a fine flour offering, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and about **one third liter** of olive oil. (Leviticus 14:10 UST)  
>> “**about six and a half liters** of a fine flour offering, mixed with olive oil, to be an offering, and about **one third liter** of olive oil.”
