1:intro	c7me					# Introduction to Titus chapter 01\n\nPaul begins his letter by reminding Titus who Paul is to God, and who Titus is to Paul. He then instructs Titus about the kind of man that Titus must appoint as elders. These elders are necessary for the health of the new believers because there were so many people in Crete who are teaching things that were not true about God, and turning people away from God.
1:1	rtc9			δοῦλος Θεοῦ	1	Paul said that he was a servant or a slave of God because he did only what he knew that God, his master, wanted him to do. Other servants of God were Moses, David, and the other prophets.
1:1	xyz8			δοῦλος	1	People who speak some modern languages think that slave is different from servant, because slaves suffer in ways that servants do not. However, the Greek word **servant** means both slave and servant. It means anyone who must obey his master. This is why Paul said he was a slave or servant of God, because he wanted to obey God in every way.
1:1	abc8			ἐκλεκτῶν Θεοῦ	1	These people were the Christians. God chose them to know him. They did this by believing in Christ. This is why they were different from all other people. Paul became a servant and apostle of God so that they would trust in Christ and know God increasingly well.
1:1	fyf8			ἐκλεκτῶν Θεοῦ	1	Scholars debate whether or not the actions of people affected whether God chose them. They also debate whether God chose people as individuals or as groups. Here, Paul wrote that God is the one who chose them.
1:2	xyz9			ἐλπίδι ζωῆς αἰωνίου	1	God has promised that everyone who trusts in Christ will live forever. The Holy Spirit makes believers to be confident that God will do this for them.
1:2	r2gj			ἣν ἐπηγγείλατο…πρὸ χρόνων αἰωνίων	1	Even before God created the earth, he planned to save his people so they would live with him forever.
1:3	b22h			κατ’ ἐπιταγὴν…Θεοῦ	1	God commanded Paul to preach to everyone. This was what he should tell them: God has promised to make everyone live eternally if they believe in Jesus Christ.
1:4	swi9			Τίτῳ	1	Titus was a Gentile believer who traveled with Paul to Crete. Paul left him there so that he would choose elders for the churches and teach the believers.
1:4	abc9			γνησίῳ τέκνῳ, κατὰ κοινὴν πίστιν	1	Paul had enabled Titus to understand how to become a Christian. This is why Paul called him a son.
1:4	m41u			χάρις καὶ εἰρήνη ἀπὸ Θεοῦ	1	This was a normal way that Christians greeted each other in letters during New Testament times.
1:5	dpn4			Κρήτῃ	1	Crete is a large island in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea.
1:5	xy18			πρεσβυτέρους	1	The word **elders** usually refers to old men. In groups of Christians, elders were men who served as the groups’ leaders.
1:5	gu55			πρεσβυτέρους	1	The leaders of Christians probably worked in much the same way as the leaders in Jewish synagogues. For example, Christian ***deacons*** were in charge of helping people in need. They were like certain synagogue leaders who worked in the same way. Synagogues also had their rabbis, whom the Jews often thought were prophets. Also, synagogues had leaders in charge of how the people worshiped on the Sabbath day. Christian groups had similar leaders.
1:6	wx6c			μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἀνήρ	1	Paul wanted elders to have only one wife; he also wanted elders to be faithful to their wives. This was very different to many ethnic groups in the Roman Empire. Many of these peoples allowed men to have more than one wife.
1:6	h93t			μιᾶς γυναικὸς ἀνήρ	1	Scholars do not agree about what Paul wanted to say when he wrote, **husband of one wife**. Some scholars think that Paul wanted every elder to have a wife. Others think that Paul wanted no elder to have more than one wives. Still other scholars think that Paul wanted all elders to be faithful to their wives.
1:7	s3yr			δεῖ…τὸν ἐπίσκοπον…εἶναι	1	Leaders guide the people who belong to God, and they act in God’s place. Because of this, they must be the good kind of people that Paul described in verses 6-9.
1:7	xy17			ἐπίσκοπον	1	Paul continued here to write about elders. He wanted them to serve as **overseers** of the church. They must be overseers who care for God’s people.
1:9	lh9b			τῇ διδασκαλίᾳ τῇ ὑγιαινούσῃ	1	Christian leaders teach believers correctly when they teach what the scriptures say.
1:10	ga62			οἱ ἐκ τῆς περιτομῆς	1	Some Jewish believers in Christ taught that all Gentile believers must become like themselves. They must be circumcised, and they must obey all the rules in the Law of Moses. Paul strongly opposed what this group taught, and he instructed Titus to do the same.
1:12	b52u			Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται, κακὰ θηρία, γαστέρες ἀργαί	1	Paul repeated words written by Epimenides, who had been a Greek poet. Epimenides had been born in Crete six or seven hundred years before Jesus was born. The people of Crete thought that he was a philosopher and prophet.
1:14	p56w			Ἰουδαϊκοῖς μύθοις	1	We do not know what these stories were. Perhaps they were stories or ideas that Jews had invented in order to explain events that had happened long ago.
1:15	wja4			πάντα καθαρὰ τοῖς καθαροῖς; τοῖς δὲ μεμιαμμένοις καὶ ἀπίστοις, οὐδὲν καθαρόν	1	Some Jewish teachers said that in order to be pure, a person must be careful not to eat certain foods, and that he must also avoid other things. But these teachers were wrong. However, believers are pure through faith in Jesus Christ, and do not need to follow those restrictions.
1:16	jen8			τοῖς…ἔργοις ἀρνοῦνται	1	When a person disobeys God, he shows by his actions that he does not believe God or his teachings. Paul was still writing here about the false teachers.
2:intro	h3il					# Introduction to Titus chapter 02\n\nIn this chapter, Paul instructs Titus on what to teach the Christian believers.  Verses 1-10 have a list of duties. These are things that different kinds of people should do, for example, men, women, children, servants, and rulers. During Paul’s time, people often wrote down ways in which everyone should behave. In these verses, Paul told Titus what he should teach the Christian believers, about how they should behave.
2:1	lfu1			σὺ δὲ	1	In 1:1-10 Paul wrote about false teachers and said why they were bad. At the start of chapter 2, Paul wrote the words **But you** very strongly, in order tell Titus that he must teach very differently from how the false teachers were teaching.
2:3	tpi2			πρεσβύτιδας	1	The older women loved God, so they were well able to teach the younger women.
2:4	ph2j			νέας	1	In verses 4-5, Paul told Titus that he must tell the older Christian women to show the younger women how to be good wives to their husbands, and good mothers to their children. In this way, the young women would show everyone that God’s Word is true and good.
2:6	xyz3			σωφρονεῖν	1	Paul summarized the responsibility of the younger men in a single phrase: **to be sensible**. This implies that the greatest weakness of the younger men was not thinking clearly and carefully, and acting in a way that was consistent with sound thinking. If the young men would learn to be sensible in their thoughts and actions, they would be honoring to God.
2:7	xy13			σεαυτὸν παρεχόμενος τύπον	1	In verses 7-8, Paul told Titus that he must live right, in order to be an example for others. This would make it difficult for unbelievers to speak against the Christian faith.
2:7	xc6t			τύπον	1	Paul’s command Titus to set an example immediately follows the verse about young men. However, it is likely that Paul wanted Titus to be an example for all the people named in verses 2-6.
2:9	y3j2			δούλους	1	If Christian **slaves** acted well toward their masters, they could persuade other people to honor Jesus Christ.
2:11	abc1			σωτήριος πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις	1	God has offered to save everyone. For that reason, believers should learn to live right, so that everyone will see that God works with power in believers.
2:12	m14y			παιδεύουσα ἡμᾶς, ἵνα	1	The grace of God teaches us to live rightly and to control ourselves. He does this because he loves us and is powerful. This different from the Jewish stories and myths in chapter 1, because those things cannot help us.
2:12	z14y			τῷ νῦν αἰῶνι	1	This present age is the time that we live in now, rather than the future when God removes all sin and evil from the world. The Bible shows that this age is different from the age that will come later. Everyone living in this age, which the Bible sometimes calls "this world," sins, does evil, and will die. Satan is the ruler of this age, but God has already started to save his people. In the age to come, God will rule the world completely. He will stop everyone from sinning and dying. He will save and his people and show them honor. God wants his people to honor him, as they wait for the age to come.
2:13	a14y			τοῦ μεγάλου Θεοῦ καὶ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Perhaps Paul was saying that Jesus is both **God** and **Savior**. Or perhaps he was writing about God the Father and about our Savior Jesus Christ. Or perhaps Paul was calling God the Father our Savior, and he was saying that Jesus is the glory that appeared to us. The sentence in Greek makes us think that Paul was saying that Jesus is both God and Savior.
2:14	gl8e			ὃς ἔδωκεν ἑαυτὸν ὑπὲρ ἡμῶν	1	When Jesus died on the cross, he freed us from having to sin, just as someone frees slaves from their masters. This means that God will not punish us for having sinned, and that he also makes us able to refuse to sin, so that we can live rightly now and honor him.
2:15	v9cp			μετὰ πάσης ἐπιταγῆς	1	Titus knew the truth about Jesus Christ, because the apostles had taught him well. So he should teach these same things well, because he knows they are true. Also, Titus should not let anyone stop him from leading the believers.
3:intro	zh6x					# Introduction to Titus chapter 03\n\nIn this chapter, Paul instructed Titus to tell the Christians how they should behave toward non-Christians so those non-Christians will understand some of the truth about God. He also reminds the believer that they themselves did not always believe in God, but God was gracious to them and save them. Therefore, they should focus on doing things that are worthwhile, and avoid things that bring strife and confict. Paul closes the letter with a several personal requests for Titus.
3:1	y9tr			ἀρχαῖς, ἐξουσίαις, ὑποτάσσεσθαι	1	Christians should obey their rulers. But if a government requires them to do something that God forbids, Christians should not obey.
3:2	j2sa			μηδένα βλασφημεῖν	1	Paul told believers that they should not say bad things about other people. Examples of bad things include falsely accusing someone to hurt their reputation, or telling lies or telling stories about people that may not even be true.
3:3	w3fy			ἦμεν	1	When Paul wrote **we**, he was writing about Titus and himself. He wanted to show that even he himself and Titus did these sinful behaviors before they believed in Jesus.
3:4	wa9x			ἡ φιλανθρωπία	1	God loves all people. The word for **love** refers to love for all people. Even if we behave badly, God loves us. When we sin, God forgives us because He loves us.
3:5	xy25			κατὰ τὸ αὐτοῦ ἔλεος	1	God decided to save people because He has mercy on them. He does not require us to do anything good before he saves us.
3:5	in7u			λουτροῦ παλινγενεσίας καὶ ἀνακαινώσεως Πνεύματος Ἁγίου	1	Paul wrote here that the Holy Spirit washes believers and makes them new people. In Ephesians 5:26, Paul wrote that Jesus washes believers and makes them new people. The Holy Spirit and Jesus work together to make God’s people spiritually clean, to forgive their sins and make them want to obey God.
3:5	lug7			παλινγενεσίας καὶ ἀνακαινώσεως	1	Christians do not always agree about how the Holy Spirit makes people new. Some Christians believe the Holy Spirit does this when a new believer is baptized in water. Other Christians say that the Holy Spirit begins to remake someone after that person has started to believe in Christ. They say that baptism only shows that the Holy Spirit has already made the believer into a new person.
3:6	abc8			ἐξέχεεν	1	Paul wrote the word **poured** to show us that God generously provided the Holy Spirit for us through our Savior Jesus Christ. He wrote about the Holy Spirit as if he were a liquid that God pours out on us abundantly.
3:7	m9zd			κληρονόμοι	1	The Bible tells us that believers are God’s children. Believers will permanently receive something from God as children receive land and possessions from their fathers. This is why the Bible says that God has an inheritance to give to his children. Like Christ, who always receives things from God, believers will possess the earth, God’s kingdom, and eternal life.
3:8	me7b			πιστὸς ὁ λόγος	1	When Paul wrote **This message is trustworthy**, he was writing about what he said in verses 4-7.
3:9	bl8e			μωρὰς…ζητήσεις, καὶ γενεαλογίας, καὶ ἔρεις, καὶ μάχας νομικὰς, περιΐστασο	1	Paul wrote that Christians should not get into arguments about Jewish rules and about things that happened in the past. Those kind of arguments do not do any good. Paul gave this same warning in chapter 1.
3:10	rrx9			αἱρετικὸν ἄνθρωπον…παραιτοῦ	1	In verses 10-11, Paul wrote that church leaders should warn people who quarrel. If the leaders do this, the believers will know that they must stop sinning. If these people repent, the leaders and the other believers must forgive them. If they do not repent, the leaders should reject them from the church so they will not cause more problems.
3:10	qt8f			αἱρετικὸν ἄνθρωπον	1	Paul was talking about the kind of person who causes quarrels within the church. Such people say that non-Jewish believers must follow Jewish rules to make God happy.
3:12	xy27			Ἀρτεμᾶν	1	Artemas worked with Paul, but we do not know any other things about him. The New Testament does not say anything else about him.
3:12	tl5n			Τυχικόν	1	Tychicus was a believer who worked with Paul. Paul trusted him. He was from the province of Asia, and he travelled with Paul on Paul’s third journey to make new believers.
3:12	dec4			ἐλθεῖν πρός με	1	When Paul wrote this letter, he was living in Nicopolis. Titus was living in Crete and working with the churches there. Artemus and Tychicus were going to Crete to replace Titus. When they arrived, Paul wanted Titus to leave Crete and come to Nicopolis, so they could be together.
3:12	y5lp			Νικόπολιν	1	When Paul wrote this letter, he was living in Nicopolis. Titus was living in Crete and working with the churches there. Artemus and Tychicus were going to Crete to replace Titus. When they arrived, Paul wanted Titus to leave Crete and come to Nicopolis, so they could be together.
3:13	xy28			σπουδαίως πρόπεμψον	1	Paul wanted Titus and the believers in Crete to give Zenas and Apollos all they would need to do their missionary work.
3:13	ba5a			Ζηνᾶν τὸν νομικὸν	1	Titus 3:13 is the only place where the New Testament says something about Zenas. He probably helped Paul in his work. There are two reasons he might have been called a lawyer. 1) If Zenas was a Jewish believer, he was probably an expert in the law of Moses. 2) If Zenas was a Gentile believer, he was probably an expert in the law of Rome.
3:13	abcg			Ἀπολλῶν	1	Apollos was someone who worked with Paul. We do not know a lot about him. He was from Alexandria in Egypt. He was a Jewish believer who became a popular speaker and persuaded many people to believe in Jesus.
3:15	abch			ἐν πίστει	1	Pauls called people who are in the faith "believers." This means that they believe in Jesus.
