JOS	front	intro	syt5			0		# Introduction to Joshua<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Joshua<br><br>1. Conquest of the land of Canaan (1:1–12:24)<br>- Preparation for conquest; spies; crossing the Jordan River (1:1–5:1)<br>- Ceremonies at Gilgal; conquest of Jericho and Ai (5:2–8:29)<br>- The covenant affirmed at Shechem (8:30–35)<br>- Southern and central campaigns; northern campaigns (9:1–12:24)<br>1. Settlement in the Promised Land; division of the land (13:1–22:34)<br>1. Joshua’s final days (23:1–24:33)<br><br>### What is the Book of Joshua about?<br><br>The Book of Joshua is about the Israelites entering and occupying the Promised Land. Joshua was the leader that replaced Moses. He led the Israelites as they fought the people living in the Promised Land. This book also tells how the Israelites divided the land among the twelve tribes. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book traditionally has the title “Joshua” because Joshua leads the people of Israel after Moses dies. Translators may create a title such as “The Book About When Joshua Led Israel.” Translators should avoid a title that suggests Joshua as the writer of the book.<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Joshua?<br><br>The book does not tell who wrote it. However, some verses in the book indicate that Joshua may have written at least part of it. Since ancient times, Jews have thought that Joshua wrote most of the book.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### How does the Book of Joshua present the cause of historical events?<br><br>In the ancient Near East, people assumed that gods caused world events to happen in a certain way. The Book of Joshua has some similarities with this view, but there are important differences. The events in the Book of Joshua occurred because Yahweh promised the Israelites that he would give them the Promised Land. What happened also depended on whether or not the Israelites obeyed Yahweh.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What does the phrase “to this day” mean?<br><br>This phrase was used by the writer to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time already passed. He must avoid giving the impression to readers that “to this day” means “to the present day.” The translator might decide to say “to this day, at the time when this was being written,” or “to this day, at the time of writing.” This Hebrew phrase occurs in Joshua 4:9; 6:25; 7:26; 8:28, 29; 10:27; 13:13; 14:14; 15:63; 16:10.<br><br>### What does the phrase “all Israel” mean?<br><br>This phrase appears many times in the Book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every person in the nation of Israel. At times it means the Israelite army. At other times it means the representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel. In still other passages, it probably means a large number of the people in the nation of Israel.<br><br>### When should Joshua be translated?<br><br>The Book of Joshua should probably not be translated before Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events of Joshua will not be understood without the information in these previous books.<br>
