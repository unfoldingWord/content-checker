JHN	front	intro	t6za			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of John<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Gospel of John<br><br>1. Introduction about who Jesus is (1:1-18)<br>1. Jesus is baptized, and he chooses twelve disciples (1:19-51)<br>1. Jesus preaches, teaches, and heals people (2-11)<br>1. The seven days before Jesus’ death (12-19)<br>- Mary anoints the feet of Jesus (12:1-11)<br>- Jesus rides a donkey into Jerusalem (12:12-19)<br>- Some Greek men want to see Jesus (12:20-36)<br>- The Jewish leaders reject Jesus (12:37-50)<br>- Jesus teaches his disciples (13-17)<br>- Jesus is arrested and undergoes trial (18:1-19:15)<br>- Jesus is crucified and buried (19:16-42)<br>1. Jesus rises from the dead (20:1-29)<br>1. John says why he wrote his gospel (20:30-31)<br>1. Jesus meets with the disciples (21)<br><br>### What is the Gospel of John about?<br><br>The Gospel of John is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. John said that he wrote his gospel “so that people might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God” (20:31).<br><br>John’s Gospel is very different from the other three Gospels. John does not include some of the teachings and events that the other writers included in their gospels. Also, John wrote about some teachings and events that are not in the other gospels.<br><br>John wrote much about the signs Jesus did to prove that what Jesus said about himself was true. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sign]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of John” or “The Gospel According to John.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News About Jesus That John Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Gospel of John?<br><br>This book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the Apostle John was the author.<br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why does John write so much about the final week of Jesus’ life?<br><br>John wrote much about Jesus’ final week. He wanted his readers to think deeply about Jesus’ final week and his death on the cross. He wanted people to understand that Jesus willingly died on the cross so that God could forgive them for sinning against him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What do the words “remain,” “reside,” and “abide” mean in the Gospel of John?<br><br>John often used the words “remain,” “reside”, and “abide” as metaphors. John spoke of a believer becoming more faithful to Jesus and knowing Jesus better as if Jesus’ word “remained” in the believer. Also, John spoke of someone being spiritually joined to someone else as if the person “remained” in the other person. Christians are said to “remain” in Christ and in God. The Father is said to “remain” in the Son, and the Son is said to “remain” in the Father. The Son is said to “remain” in believers. The Holy Spirit is also said to “remain” in the believers.<br><br>Many translators will find it impossible to represent these ideas in their languages in exactly the same way. For example, Jesus intended to express the idea of the Christian being spiritually together with him when he said, “He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him” (John 6:56). The UST uses the idea of “will be joined to me, and I will be joined to him.” But translators may have to find other ways of expressing the idea.<br><br>In the passage, “If my words remain in you” (John 15:7), the UST expresses this idea as, “If you live by my message.” Translators may find it possible to use this translation as a model.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Gospel of John?<br><br>The following verses found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions. Translators are advised not to translate these verses. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include these verses, the translators can include them. If they are translated, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to John’s Gospel.<br><br>* “waiting for the moving of the water. For an angel of the Lord occasionally went down into the pool and stirred the water and whoever went first after the stirring of the water, was made well from the disease they had.” (5:3-4)<br>* “going through the midst of them, and so passed by” (8:59)<br><br>The following passage is included in most older and modern versions of the Bible. But it is not in the earliest copies of the Bible. Translators are advised to translate this passage. It should be put inside of square brackets ([]) to indicate that it may not have been original to John’s Gospel.<br><br>* The story of the adulterous woman (7:53–8:11)<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
JHN	1	intro	k29b			0		# John 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 1:23, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “The Word”<br><br>John uses the phrase “the Word” to refer to Jesus ([John 1:1, 14](./01.md)). John is saying that God’s most important message to all people is actually Jesus, a person with a physical body. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/wordofgod]])<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### “Children of God”<br><br>When people believes in Jesus, they go from being “children of wrath” to “children of God.” They are adopted into the “family of God.”They are adopted into the “family of God.” This is an important image that will be unfolded in the New Testament. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adoption]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphors<br><br>John uses the metaphors of light and darkness and of the Word to tell the reader that he will be writing more about good and evil and about what God wants to tell people through Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “In the beginning”<br><br>Some languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But “very long ago” is different from “in the beginning,” and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 1:51](../../jhn/01/51.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “It was necessary for him to pass through Samaria”<br><br>Jews avoided traveling through the region of Samaria because the Samaritans were descendants of ungodly people. So Jesus had to do what most Jews did not want to do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/names/kingdomofisrael]])<br><br>### “The hour is coming”<br><br>Jesus used these words to begin prophecies about times that could be shorter or longer than sixty minutes. “The hour” in which true worshipers will worship in spirit and truth is longer than sixty minutes.<br><br>### The proper place of worship<br><br>Long before Jesus lived, the Samaritan people had broken the law of Moses by setting up a false temple in their land ([John 4:20](../../jhn/04/20.md)). Jesus explained to the woman that it was no longer important where people worshiped ([John 4:21-24](./21.md)).<br><br>### Harvest<br><br>Harvest is when people go out to get the food they have planted so they can bring it to their houses and eat it. Jesus used this as a metaphor to teach his followers that they need to go and tell other people about Jesus so those people can be part of God’s kingdom. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### “The Samaritan woman”<br><br>John probably told this story to show the difference between the Samaritan woman, who believed, and the Jews, who did not believe and later killed Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “In spirit and truth”<br><br>The people who truly know who God is and enjoy worshiping him and love him for who he is are the ones who truly please him. Where they worship is not important.

JHN	5	intro	qe17			0		# John 05 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Healing water<br><br>Many of the Jews believed that God would heal people who got into some of the pools in Jerusalem when the waters were “stirred up.”<br><br>### Testimony<br><br>Testimony is what one person says about another person. What a person says about himself is not as important as what other people say about that person. Jesus told the Jews that God had told them who Jesus was, so he did not need to tell them who he was. This was because God had told the writers of the Old Testament what his Messiah would do, and Jesus had done everything they had written that he would do.<br><br>### The resurrection of life and the resurrection of judgment<br><br>God will make some people alive again and because he gives them his grace, they will live with him forever. But he will make some people alive again and because he will treat them justly, they will live apart from him forever.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### The Son, the Son of God, and the Son of Man<br><br>Jesus refers to himself in this chapter as the “Son” ([John 5:19](../../jhn/05/19.md)), the “Son of God” ([John 5:25](../../jhn/05/25.md)), and the “Son of Man” ([John 5:27](../../jhn/05/27.md)).

JHN	6	intro	xe4t			0		# John 06 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### King<br><br>The king of any nation was the richest and most powerful person in that nation. The people wanted Jesus to be their king because he gave them food and so they thought he would make the Jews into the richest and most powerful nation in the world. They did not understand that Jesus came to die so God could forgive his people’s sins and that the world would persecute his people.<br><br>## Important metaphors in this chapter<br><br>### Bread<br><br>Bread was the most common and important food in Jesus’ day, and so the word “bread” was their general word for “food.” It is often difficult to translate the word “bread” into the languages of people who do not eat bread because the general word for food in some languages refers to food that did not exist in Jesus’ culture. Jesus used the word “bread” to refer to himself. He wanted them to understand that they need him so they can have eternal life. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])<br><br>### Eating the flesh and drinking the blood<br><br>When Jesus said, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will not have life in yourselves,” he knew that before he died he would tell his followers to do this by eating bread and drinking wine. In the event this chapter describes, he expected that his hearers would understand that he was using a metaphor but would not understand what the metaphor referred to. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/flesh]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Parenthetical Ideas<br>Several times in this passage, John explains something or gives the reader some context to better understand the story. These explanation are intended to give the reader some additional knowledge without interrupting the flow of the narrative. The information is placed inside parentheses.<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 6;26](./26.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	7	intro	l712			0		# John 07 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This whole chapter concerns the concept of believing Jesus to be the Messiah. Some people believed this to be true while others rejected it. Some were willing to recognize his power and even the possibility that he was a prophet, but most were unwilling to believe that he was the Messiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])<br><br>Translators may wish to include a note at verse 53 to explain to the reader why they have chosen or chosen not to translate verses 7:53-8:11.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “My time has not yet come”<br>This phrase and “his hour had not yet come” are used in this chapter to indicate that Jesus is in control of the events unfolding in his life.<br><br>### “Living water”<br>This is an important image used in the New Testament. It is a metaphor. Because this metaphor is given in a desert environment, it probably emphasizes that Jesus is able to give life sustaining nourishment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Prophecy<br>Jesus gives a prophecy about his life without an explicit statement in John [John 7:33-34](./33.md).<br><br>### Irony<br>Nicodemus explains to the other Pharisees that the Law requires him to hear directly from a person before making a judgment about them. The Pharisees in turn made a judgment about Jesus without speaking to Jesus.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Did not believe in him”<br>Jesus’ brothers did not believe Jesus was the Messiah. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])<br><br>### “The Jews”<br>This term is used in two different ways in this passage. It is used specifically in reference to the opposition of the Jewish leaders who were trying to kill him ([John 7:1](../../jhn/07/01.md)). It is also used in reference to the people of Judea in general who had a positive opinion of Jesus ([John 7:13](../../jhn/07/13.md)). The translator may wish to use the terms “Jewish leaders” and “Jewish people” or “Jews (leaders)” and “Jews (in general).”

JHN	8	intro	e667			0		# John 08 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Translators may wish to include a note at verse 1 to explain to the reader why they have chosen to translate or to not translate verses 8:1-11.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### A light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. Here it is all Gentiles (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### I AM<br><br>John records Jesus as saying these words four times in this book, three times in this chapter. They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew word for “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses. For these reasons, many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).<br><br>### The Scribes and Pharisees’ trap<br><br>The Scribes and Pharisees wanted to trick Jesus. They wanted him to say either that they should keep the law of Moses by killing a woman whom they had found committing adultery or that they should disobey the law of Moses and forgive her sin. Jesus knew that they were trying to trick him and that they did not really want to keep the law of Moses. He knew this because the law said that both the woman and the man should die, but they did not bring the man to Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 8:28](../../jhn/08/28.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	9	intro	hq31			0		# John 09 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Who sinned?”<br><br>Many of the Jews of Jesus’ time believed that if a person was blind or deaf or crippled, it was because he or his parents or someone in his family had sinned. This was not the teaching of the law of Moses. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>### “He does not keep the Sabbath”<br><br>The Pharisees thought that Jesus was working, and so breaking the Sabbath, by making mud. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>## Important metaphors in this chapter<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Seeing and being blind<br><br>Jesus calls the Pharisees blind because they see that Jesus is able to heal blind people but they still do not believe that God sent him ([John 9:39-40](./39.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 9:35](../../jhn/09/35.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	10	intro	e8mb			0		# John 10 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Blasphemy<br><br>When a person claims that he is God or that God has told him to speak when God has not told him to speak, this is called blasphemy. The law of Moses commanded the Israelites to kill blasphemers by stoning them to death. When Jesus said, “I and the Father are one,” the Jews thought he was blaspheming, so they took up stones to kill him. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Important metaphors in this chapter<br><br>### Sheep<br><br>Jesus spoke of people as sheep because sheep do not see well, they do not think well, they often walk away from those who care for them, and they cannot defend themselves when other animals attack them. God’s people also rebel against him and do not know when they are doing wrong.<br><br>### Sheep pen<br><br>A sheep pen was a space with a stone wall around it in which shepherds would keep their sheep. Once they were inside the sheep pen, the sheep could not run away, and animals and thieves could not easily get inside to kill or steal them.<br><br>### Laying down and taking up life<br><br>Jesus speaks of his life as if it were a physical object that he could lay down on the ground, a metaphor for dying, or pick up again, a metaphor for becoming alive again.

JHN	11	intro	tks5			0		# John 11 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### Passover<br><br>After Jesus made Lazarus become alive again, the Jewish leaders were trying hard to kill him, so he started traveling from place to place in secret. Now the Pharisees knew that he would probably come to Jerusalem for the Passover because God had commanded all Jewish men to celebrate the Passover in Jerusalem, so they planned to catch him and kill him then. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### “One man dies for the people”<br><br>The law of Moses commanded the priests to kill animals so that God would forgive the people’s sins. The high priest Caiaphas said, “It is better for you that one man dies for the people than that the whole nation perishes” ([John 10:50](../../jhn/10/50.md)). He said this because he loved his “place” and “nation” ([John 10:48](../../jhn/10/48.md)) more than he loved the God who had made Lazarus become alive again. He wanted Jesus to die so that the Romans would not destroy the temple and Jerusalem, but God wanted Jesus to die so that he could forgive all of his people’s sins.<br><br>### Hypothetical situation<br><br>When Martha said, “If you had been here, my brother would not have died,” she was speaking of a situation that could have happened but did not happen.

JHN	12	intro	qzv4			0		# John 12 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:38 and 40, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>Verse 16 is a commentary on these events. It is possible to put this entire verse in parentheses in order to set it apart from the narrative of the story.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Mary anointed Jesus’ feet<br><br>The Jews would put oil on a person’s head to make that person feel welcome and comfortable. They would also put oil on a person’s body after the person had died but before they buried the body. But they would never think to put oil on a person’s feet, because they thought that feet were dirty.<br><br>### The donkey and the colt<br><br>Jesus rode into Jerusalem on an animal. In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses. So Jesus was showing that he was the king of Israel and that he was not like other kings.<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about this event. Matthew and Mark wrote that the disciples brought Jesus a donkey. John wrote that Jesus found a donkey. Luke wrote that they brought him a colt. Only Matthew wrote that there were both a donkey had a colt. No one knows for sure whether Jesus rode the donkey or the colt. It is best to translate each of these accounts as it appears in the ULT without trying to make them all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 21:1-7](../../mat/21/01.md) and [Mark 11:1-7](../../mrk/11/01.md) and [Luke 19:29-36](../../luk/19/29.md) and [John 12:14-15](../../jhn/12/14.md))<br><br>### Glory<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. In this chapter John says that the glory of Jesus is his resurrection ([John 12:16](../../jhn/12/16.md)).<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### The metaphors of light and darkness<br><br>The Bible often speaks of unrighteous people, people who do not do what pleases God, as if they were walking around in darkness. It speaks of light as if it were what enables those sinful people to become righteous, to understand what they are doing wrong and begin to obey God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. A paradox occurs in 12:25: “He who loves his life will lose it; but he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.” But in 12:26 Jesus explains what it means to keep one’s life for eternal life. ([John 12:25-26](./25.md)).

JHN	13	intro	zk68			0		# John 13 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The events of this chapter are commonly referred to as the last supper or the Lord’s supper. This Passover feast in many ways parallels Jesus’ sacrifice as the lamb of God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/passover]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The washing of feet<br><br>People in the ancient Near East thought that feet were very dirty. Only servants would wash people’s feet. The disciples did not want Jesus to wash their feet because they considered him their master and themselves his servants, but he wanted to show them that they needed to serve each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])<br><br>### I AM<br><br>John records Jesus as saying these words four times in this book, once in this chapter. They stand alone as a complete sentence, and they literally translate the Hebrew word for “I AM,” by which Yahweh identified himself to Moses. For these reasons, many people believe that when Jesus said these words he was claiming to be Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]]).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Son of Man”<br><br>Jesus refers to himself as the “Son of Man” in this chapter ([John 13:31](../../jhn/13/31.md)). Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking about someone else. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

JHN	18	intro	ltl2			0		# John 18 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Verse 14 says, “Now Caiaphas was the one who had given the advice to the Jews that it would be better that one man die for the people.” The author says this to help the reader understand why it was to Caiaphas that they took Jesus. You might want to put these words in parentheses. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death”<br><br>The Roman government did not allow the Jews to kill criminals, so the Jews needed to ask Pilate, the governor, to kill him ([John 18:31](../../jhn/18/31.md)).<br><br>### Jesus’ kingdom<br><br>No one knows for sure what Jesus meant when he told Pilate that his kingdom was not “of this world” ([John 18:36](../../jhn/18/36.md)). Some people think that Jesus means that his kingdom is only spiritual and that he has no visible kingdom on this earth, Other people think that Jesus meant that he would not build and rule his kingdom by force, the way other kings build theirs. It is possible to translate the words “is not of this world” as “is not from this place” or “comes from another place.”<br><br>### King of the Jews<br><br>When Pilate asked if Jesus were the King of the Jews ([John 18:33](../../jhn/18/33.md)), he was asking if Jesus were claiming to be like King Herod, whom the Romans were permitting to rule Judea. When he asked the crowd if he should release the King of the Jews ([John 18:39](../../jhn/18/39.md)), he is mocking the Jews, because the Romans and Jews hated each other. He was also mocking Jesus, because he did not think that Jesus was a king at all. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])

JHN	19	intro	u96u			0		# John 19 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 19:24, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Purple garment”<br><br>Purple is a color like red or blue. The people were mocking Jesus, so they put him in a purple garment. This was because kings wore purple garments. They spoke and acted like they were giving honor to a king, but everyone knew that they were doing it because they hated Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### “You are not Caesar’s friend”<br><br>Pilate knew that Jesus was not a criminal, so he did not want to have his soldiers kill him. But the Jews told him that Jesus was claiming to be a king, and anyone who did that was breaking Caesar’s laws ([John 19:12](../../jhn/19/12.md)).<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([John 19:41](../../jhn/19/41.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Sarcasm<br><br>The soldiers were insulting Jesus when they said, “Hail, King of the Jews.” Pilate was insulting the Jews when he asked, “Should I crucify your king?” He was probably also insulting both Jesus and the Jews when he wrote, “Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Gabbatha, Golgotha<br><br>These are two Hebrew words. After translating the meanings of these words (“The Pavement” and “The Place of a Skull”), the author transliterates their sounds by writing them with Greek letters.

JHN	20	intro	nm1y			0		# John 20 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([John 20:1](../../jhn/20/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>### “Receive the Holy Spirit”<br><br>If your language uses the same word for “breath” and “spirit,” be sure that the reader understands that Jesus was performing a symbolic action by breathing, and that what the disciples received was the Holy Spirit, not Jesus’ breath. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Rabboni<br><br>John used Greek letters to describe the sound of the word, and then he explained that it means “Teacher.” You should do the same, using the letters of your language.<br><br>### Jesus’ resurrection body<br><br>No one is sure what Jesus’ body looked like after he became alive again. His disciples knew it was Jesus because they could see his face and touch the places where the soldiers had put the nails through his hands and feet, But he could also walk through solid walls and doors. It is best not to try to say more than what the ULT says.<br><br>### Two angels in white<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels were in human form. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))
