EST	front	intro	d989			0		# Introduction to Esther<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Esther<br><br>1. King Ahasuerus sends away his wife, the queen (1:1–22)<br>1. Ahasuerus chooses Esther as the new queen (2:1–23)<br>1. Haman plots to destroy the Jews (3:1–15)<br>1. Mordecai asks Esther to help her people (4:1–17)<br>1. Esther pleads with the king for the Jews (5:1–7:10)<br>1. The result of Haman’s plot to destroy the Jews (8:1–9:16)<br>1. The Feast of Purim (9:17–32)<br>1. Conclusion (10:1–3)<br><br>### What is the Book of Esther about?<br><br>The Book of Esther tells how a young Jewish woman named Esther became the queen of Persia. As queen, she worked to save all the Jews in the Persian Empire from being destroyed.<br><br>This book ends by telling why the Jews celebrate the festival of Purim. The name “Purim” comes from the word “pur.” It means “lots” or “dice.” Haman, the enemy of Jews, threw dice to choose when to attack and destroy the Jews. The Jews celebrate Purim to remember how Yahweh rescued his people from being destroyed.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators can use the traditional title of this book, which is “The Book of Esther” or just “Esther.” Or they can choose a clearer title, such as “The Book About Esther.”<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the Persian Empire?<br><br>King Cyrus the Great conquered and ruled over many kingdoms. This was in the part of the world called Persia, which is now Iran. So people named his kingdom the Persian Empire. When Cyrus conquered Babylonia in 539 B.C., he then controlled the Jews whom the Babylonians had exiled.<br><br>### Why were there Jews in Babylonia when the Persians conquered it?<br><br>In 586 B.C., the Babylonians conquered and took into exile the people of Judah. These Jews and their descendants were still in Babylon when the Persians conquered it.<br><br>### What was meant by “the laws of the Medes and Persians”?<br><br>The phrase “the laws of the Medes and Persians” is found in Esther 1:19 and Daniel 6:12. It referred to laws and decrees that could not be changed or removed once they were issued. In the book of Esther, the king made a decree that the people could attack the Jews. Later he regretted that decision but he was not able to change the decree.<br><br>The term “Medes” refers to a people group that had formed its own nation, but the Persians conquered them.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What different levels of language are in the Book of Esther?<br><br>In the Book of Esther, people talk to each other in many different situations. There is the polite and stately talk in the Persian court and the words of royal decrees. Friends and close relatives also talk to each other. There are even the words that one uses in speaking to oneself. Translators should use all the ways their own language has to express these different situations in a way that their readers will identify and understand.
EST	1	intro	v1fp			0		# Esther 01 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The king’s divorce<br><br>The king’s advisers were afraid that husbands would lose their authority when they heard the queen had refused to come to show her beauty to the king’s guests; so the advisers told him to divorce her.
EST	1	1	jdr1	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֖י	1	Now it happened	In the Old Testament, this is a standard way of beginning a historical story. Many languages have similar story-opening formulas, and if your language has one, you can use it. But do not use it if it would suggest that the story is not real, only made up. Alternate translation: “This account happened” (See: Introduction of a New Event) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EST	1	1	zzz2	bita-phenom	בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ	1	In the days of Ahasuerus	The term **day** is used figuratively here to refer to a longer period of time. You could just say “during the reign of Ahasuerus,” as UST does. But as an alternative, you could say, “in the time of Ahasuerus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	1	1	qwe1	translate-names	אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ	1	Ahasuerus	This is a man’s name. It occurs many times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	1	1	v5ts	writing-background	ה֣וּא אֲחַשְׁוֵר֗וֹשׁ הַ⁠מֹּלֵךְ֙ מֵ⁠הֹ֣דּוּ וְ⁠עַד־כּ֔וּשׁ שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה	1	he was Ahasuerus the one who ruled from India even as far as Ethiopia, 127 provinces	This is background information to help the reader identify Ahasuerus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EST	1	1	qwe3		ה֣וּא אֲחַשְׁוֵר֗וֹשׁ הַ⁠מֹּלֵךְ֙	1	he was Ahasuerus, the one who ruled	“This king named Ahasuerus ruled”
EST	1	1	qwe5	writing-background	מֵ⁠הֹ֣דּוּ וְ⁠עַד־כּ֔וּשׁ	1	from India even as far as Ethiopia	In case your audience might not know where these places are, you could say, “extending from India in the east to Ethiopia in the west.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EST	1	1	qwe7	writing-background	שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה	1	127 provinces	The number is given to show what a large empire this was. You could say that explicitly: “Ahasuerus ruled a very large empire that had 127 provinces.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EST	1	1	qwe8	translate-numbers	שֶׁ֛בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֥ים וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה מְדִינָֽה	1	127 provinces	Alternate translation: “one hundred twenty seven provinces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EST	1	2	dk31	bita-humanbehavior	כְּ⁠שֶׁ֣בֶת…עַ֚ל כִּסֵּ֣א מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	sat on the throne of his royalty	Here the action of **sitting** on a throne is used figuratively to mean ruling over a kingdom. You could just say “ruled,” as UST does. But as an alternative, you could say, “ruled his empire from his royal throne” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	1	2	qwe9	figs-abstractnouns	עַ֚ל כִּסֵּ֣א מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	the throne of his royalty	**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate this idea with a verb, “the throne he ruled from,” or an adjective, “his royal throne.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	1	2	hgm3	translate-names	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֥ן	1	in Susa	This was the name of a royal city of the Persian kings. It occurs many times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	1	2	qwr1	translate-unknown	הַ⁠בִּירָֽה	1	the citadel	This means a “castle” or “palace” where a king would live. But since the city of Susa itself is being called a “citadel” here, it’s likely that the term figuratively means “royal city” or “capital city.” The person telling this story is identifying Susa as the capital by calling it by the name of something closely associated with it, the royal palace within it. A good translation might be “the capital city of Persia.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	1	3	ry7m	translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֤ת שָׁלוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠מָלְכ֔⁠וֹ	1	in the third year of his reign	This means that Ahasuerus had already ruled for two full years and that these events took place in the year that followed them. Alternate translation: “during the third year that Ahasuerus ruled his empire” or “after he had ruled for two years” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EST	1	3	qwr3	figs-abstractnouns	בִּ⁠שְׁנַ֤ת שָׁלוֹשׁ֙ לְ⁠מָלְכ֔⁠וֹ	1	in the third year of his reign	**Reign** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate it with a verb: “during the third year that Ahasuerus ruled” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	1	3	qwr5		עָשָׂ֣ה מִשְׁתֶּ֔ה	1	he made a feast	“he hosted a feast”
EST	1	3	prm1	figs-synecdoche	חֵ֣יל ׀ פָּרַ֣ס וּ⁠מָדַ֗י	1	the army of Persia and Media	This likely refers to the leaders of the army. It is describing a part of the army by referring to the whole army. Alternate translation: “the officers of the army” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EST	1	3	qwr7		הַֽ⁠פַּרְתְּמִ֛ים	1	the noblemen	This probably means something like “the wealthy landowners.”
EST	1	3	jdr3	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	before his face	**Face** figuratively stands for the presence of a person, so this phrase means “in his presence.” The invitation was to come to the royal capital to attend a banquet where the king would be present in person. You could say, as UST does, that the king was present in person to host the feast. Or you could say as an alternative, “All of them came to Susa for the feast.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	1	4	qwr9	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ אֶת־עֹ֨שֶׁר֙ כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	when he displayed the wealth of the glory of his kingdom	You can translate the abstract noun with an emphasized adjective. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus … wanted to demonstrate … the great wealth of his kingdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	1	4	qet1	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ	1	when he displayed	“He” refers to the king. The implication is that he held this banquet was to show all of his officials how wealthy and powerful he was. The invited officials would then go back to all the different parts of the empire and tell everyone this. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus wanted to demonstrate to his guests” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	1	4	m8xa	figs-doublet	עֹ֨שֶׁר֙ כְּב֣וֹד מַלְכוּת֔⁠וֹ	1	the wealth of the glory of his kingdom	The words “wealth” and “glory” have similar meanings and they are used together to emphasize how great his kingdom was. Alternate translation: “the great wealth of his kingdom” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	1	4	qet3	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠הַרְאֹת֗⁠וֹ…וְ⁠אֶ֨ת־יְקָ֔ר תִּפְאֶ֖רֶת גְּדוּלָּת֑⁠וֹ	1	when he displayed…the splendor of the beauty of his greatness	You can translate abstract nouns “splendor,” “beauty,” and “greatness” as adjectives.

EST	1	4	qet5	figs-explicit	יָמִ֣ים רַבִּ֔ים שְׁמוֹנִ֥ים וּ⁠מְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם	1	for many days, for 180 days	This was a very long time for a royal feast to last. The earlier part of the verse provides the reason for this. To make the connection explicit, you could add some explanatory words to the verse like this: “Ahasuerus entertained his guests fabulously, because he wanted to demonstrate that his empire was extremely wealthy and that he was a very powerful king. He did so many things for them that the festivities lasted for six months.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	1	4	x1v6	translate-numbers	שְׁמוֹנִ֥ים וּ⁠מְאַ֖ת יֽוֹם	1	for 180 days	180 days is about six months or about half a year. You can use whatever expression will best express this time period in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EST	1	5	ue3x	figs-explicit	וּ⁠בִ⁠מְל֣וֹאת ׀ הַ⁠יָּמִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֗לֶּה	1	And when those days were fulfilled	The implication is, “at the end of that feast.” You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “after those 180 days were over” or “at the end of those six months” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	1	5	fv9y	translate-numbers	עָשָׂ֣ה הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ…מִשְׁתֶּ֖ה	1	the king made a feast	This was a second feast that the king hosted. He likely did this to thank the people who had worked so hard in hosting the first feast. You could say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	1	5	mj16	translate-unknown	בְּ⁠שׁוּשַׁ֨ן הַ⁠בִּירָ֜ה	1	in Susa the citadel	The expression in this case seems to refer specifically to the royal citadel from which the city got its name. This second feast would not have been for everyone in the entire city. It was specifically for the people who served the king in the citadel and who had worked so hard over the previous six months hosting the first feast. Alternate translation: “for every man who worked for him in the palace at Susa.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	1	5	qet7	figs-idiom	הַ⁠נִּמְצְאִים֩	1	who were found	Here **found** is an idiom that means “could be found” or “were there.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	1	5	qet9	figs-activepassive	הַ⁠נִּמְצְאִים֩	1	who were found	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “who worked for him in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	1	5	qey1	figs-merism	לְ⁠מִ⁠גָּ֧דוֹל וְ⁠עַד־קָטָ֛ן	1	from the greatest even to the least	The person telling this story is referring to the staff of the palace by speaking of two extreme parts of it, the most important and the least important people who worked there, in order to include everyone in between. You could just explain this meaning, as UST does. Alternate translation: “from the most important official to the least important servant” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EST	1	5	qey3		שִׁבְעַ֣ת יָמִ֑ים	1	for seven days	Alternate translation: “another feast that lasted seven days” The story does not suggest that this was an unusually long time by saying “for many days.” But you could also say something like “a whole week” to show that this was a generous gesture of thanks on the part of the king.
EST	1	6	qey5	translate-unknown	ח֣וּר ׀ כַּרְפַּ֣ס וּ⁠תְכֵ֗לֶת	1	Linens cotton and blue	These **linens** were curtains that were hung in the courtyard. “Cotton” refers to the white color of some of them. So this means “white and blue curtains. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	1	6	qey7		ח֣וּר ׀ כַּרְפַּ֣ס וּ⁠תְכֵ֗לֶת	1	Linens cotton and blue	You can specify at the start of this verse that the location being described is the same as in the previous verse: “In the courtyard, white and blue curtains.”
EST	1	6	qey9	translate-unknown	בְּ⁠חַבְלֵי־ב֣וּץ וְ⁠אַרְגָּמָ֔ן	1	by cords of byssus and purple	**Byssus** means “white linen” and it is used to describe the white color of some of these cords. So this means “white and purple cords.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	1	6	qru1	figs-explicit	מִטּ֣וֹת ׀ זָהָ֣ב וָ⁠כֶ֗סֶף	1	couches of gold and silver	You can specify that these couches were there for the guests to recline on while they ate. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	1	6	asn4	translate-unknown	רִֽצְפַ֥ת	1	a pavement	This word probably refers to a mosaic floor made of inlaid pieces of colorful precious stones.
EST	1	6	eyi2	translate-unknown	בַּהַט	1	porphyry	This is a kind of red and purple stone that contains pieces of crystal. You could call it “feldspar,” or say something descriptive like “red marble.” (See: Translate Unknowns) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	1	6	qru3	translate-unknown	וָ⁠שֵׁ֖שׁ	1	and alabaster	This is a white precious stone. You could identify it as “alabaster.” Alternatively, while it is not exactly the same thing as marble, your readers would get the right idea if you called it “white marble.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	1	6	qru5	translate-unknown	וְ⁠סֹחָֽרֶת	1	and precious stone	This word probably refers to a black marble that was used to create borders around mosaics. You could call this “black marble,” or you could just say that the floor contained “another precious stone.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	1	7	urm7	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠הַשְׁקוֹת֙	1	And the serving was	The abstract noun **serving** refers to how the drinks were served at the banquet. You can translate it with a verb: “The attendants served wine.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	1	7	qru7		⁠כֵלִ֖ים מִ⁠כֵּלִ֣ים שׁוֹנִ֑ים	1	with vessels different from other vessels	This could mean that “no two of them were alike.” But you could also just say that the wine was served in “various kinds of golden cups.”
EST	1	7	r6ec	figs-explicit	וְ⁠יֵ֥ין מַלְכ֛וּת רָ֖ב כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	and the wine of royalty was abundant according to the hand of the king	This means that King Ahasuerus himself paid for all the wine that the guests drank at his seven-day feast in Susa, and it came from his personal supply. Alternate translation: “the king was very generous with the royal wine” or “the king showed a great willingness to give” or “the king provided all of it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	1	7	qru9	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠יֵ֥ין מַלְכ֛וּת רָ֖ב כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	and the wine of royalty	This probably means special fine wine that only the king could acquire and afford. You can translate the abstract noun “royalty” with an adjective. Alternate translation: “royal wine.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	1	7	wpq1	bita-hq	כְּ⁠יַ֥ד הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	according to the hand of the king	Here **hand** refers figuratively to the king himself, viewed through his action of giving. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	1	8	qtu1	figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁתִיָּ֥ה כַ⁠דָּ֖ת	1	the drinking was according to the law	The abstract noun **drinking** refers here not to the action of drinking, but to the guidelines for serving drinks that the king had established for the banquet. Alternate translation: “Ahasuerus had established this rule for all his household attendants who served the wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	1	8	g5gu	figs-explicit	אֵ֣ין אֹנֵ֑ס	1	There is no compulsion	This could mean one of two things. (1) No one would be stopped from drinking, even if the attendants thought they had already had enough. Alternate translation: “There was to be no restriction on drinking.” (2) There would be no requirement to drink. Alternate translation: “No one must be forced to drink.” Either way, this was another sign of the generosity that the king showed as he hosted this banquet to thank the people who worked for him. Either he was (1) allowing them to drink as much as they wanted to, or (2) not requiring them to eat and drink everything that was served at a banquet, as guests of the king would usually have to do. You could say explicitly at the beginning of the verse that the king was giving his guests a special privilege. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	1	8	f6px	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּי־כֵ֣ן ׀ יִסַּ֣ד הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ עַ֚ל כָּל־רַ֣ב בֵּית֔⁠וֹ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת כִּ⁠רְצ֥וֹן אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ	1	for thus the king had established for every overseer of his house, to do according to the desire of man by man	Alternate translation: “The king made the attendants who served the wine follow this rule.” This explains why no one had to drink if they did not want to. If it would be clearer in your language, you can give this explanation (the reason) before the result that it accounts for, using a connecting word like “so”: “the king had established for every overseer of his house to do according to the desire of man by man, so the drinking was according to the law, ‘There is no compulsion.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EST	1	8	qtu3		לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת כִּ⁠רְצ֥וֹן אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ	1	to do according to the desire of man by man	Alternate translation: “The king wanted every guest to be able to drink as much as he wanted,” or “All the guests could drink as little or as much as they wanted.”
EST	1	8	jdr5	figs-idiom	אִישׁ־וָ⁠אִֽישׁ	1	man by man	This is an idiom that means “everyone.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	1	9	qtu5	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	גַּ֚ם	1	Also	This introduces something else that was happening at the same time. You can indicate this by saying something like, “During this time.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
EST	1	9	qtu7	writing-participants	וַשְׁתִּ֣י הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֔ה	1	Vashti the queen	You can explain that she was the wife of Ahasuerus: “Queen Vashti, the king’s wife” or “his wife.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])
EST	1	9	qtu9	translate-names	וַשְׁתִּ֣י הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֔ה	1	Vashti	This is a woman’s name. It occurs several times in this chapter and the next one. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	1	9	qti1		מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה נָשִׁ֑ים	1	a feast of women	This could mean the women who served in the palace, the wives of the men who were officers and servants, or both. You could say “a feast for the wives of the men who attended” or “for the women who worked in the palace.”
EST	1	9	qti3		בֵּ֚ית הַ⁠מַּלְכ֔וּת אֲשֶׁ֖ר לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֽוֹשׁ	1	the house of royalty that belonged to the king Ahasuerus	Alternate translation: “the royal palace where King Ahasuerus lived”
EST	1	9	qti5	figs-abstractnouns	בֵּ֚ית הַ⁠מַּלְכ֔וּת	1	house of royalty	You can translate the abstract noun “royalty” with the adjective “royal.” Alternate translation: “royal palace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	1	10	jv7z	translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּוֹם֙ הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	On the seventh day	Alternate translation: “After 6 days” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EST	1	10	le6l	bita-hq	כְּ⁠ט֥וֹב לֵב־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ בַּ⁠יָּ֑יִן	1	when the heart of the king was pleased by the wine	Here **heart** figuratively means the action of thinking or feeling. Alternate translation: “when King Ahasuerus was in a good mood from drinking wine” or “when the king was drunk with wine” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

EST	1	10	ens5	translate-unknown	הַ⁠סָּ֣רִיסִ֔ים	1	the…eunuchs	This term occurs a dozen times in the story. It describes male royal officials whose served as guardians for the women who lived in the palace. They were both guardians of the door, to keep unwanted people out of the women’s quarters, and guardians of the women inside, to take care of them and look after their needs. (As we learn in 2:21, some of these officials also protected the king’s private quarters.) As we see here, and as will also be seen in 2:14 and 2:16, their duties included escorting women from place to place. The term likely indicates that, in keeping with the practices of the time, these men were castrated because their work brought them into such close contact with the king’s wives and concubines. If your language has a term for such an official and you think your readers would recognize it, you can use it. Otherwise, you can use a term that describes the role that these officials played in the royal court. Alternate translation: “guardians” or “officials” or “castrated servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	1	10	qti7	writing-background	הַ⁠מְשָׁ֣רְתִ֔ים אֶת־פְּנֵ֖י הַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֽוֹשׁ	1	who served before the face of King Ahasuerus	This is background information to explain who these men were. Alternate translation: “who attended him personally.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EST	1	10	jdr7	bita-hq	פְּנֵ֖י הַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ	1	the face of King	Here **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. The phrase means that these seven men served King Ahasuerus personally. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	1	11	qti9	figs-explicit	לְ֠⁠הָבִיא	1	to bring	This is the beginning of the instructions that King Ahasuerus gave to the seven eunuchs he summoned in verse 10. You can make this explicit: “He told them to bring.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

He seems to have believed that having a very beautiful wife was one more thing that proved he was a great man. So he wanted everyone to see how beautiful Vashti was. You can put this second in the verse, after explaining that Vashti was a very beautiful woman, because it accounts for what happens afterwards, when the king sends his seven personal servants to bring her in to his banquet.

EST	1	22	agj7	figs-explicit	כִּ⁠לְשׁ֥וֹן עַמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	speaking according to the tongue of his people	The implication is that the husband ought to be able to give orders to his wife in his own native language and that she should understand and obey him, even if she had to learn his language to do so. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

This could actually mean that when he thought about Vashti and what she had done, he regretted the decision that he had made about her. But there was nothing he could do to bring her back, because the laws of the empire could not be changed. You could explain all or some of this in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	2	1	agk1	figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁר־נִגְזַ֖ר עָלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	what had been decided	You can say this with an active form, and you can say that the king performed the action. Alternate translation: “what he had decided” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

You could call them his “personal servants.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	2	2	agk5	figs-explicit	יְבַקְשׁ֥וּ לַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ נְעָר֥וֹת	1	Let them seek for the king young women	Implicit in this suggestion is the idea, “You should get a new wife for yourself.” You can say that explicitly at the beginning of the advice that the young men give to the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	2	2	s4hv	figs-activepassive	יְבַקְשׁ֥וּ	1	Let them seek	**Them** means the servants that the king would send to do this. You should express this in a form that shows it is a suggestion, not a command, for example: “You could send some men to look for.”
EST	2	2	abt8	figs-123person	לַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ	1	for the king	The young men speak to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternatively, you could have them say “for yourself” or “on your behalf.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

EST	2	3	jd49	bita-hq	יַ֥ד הֵגֶ֛א	1	the hand of Hegai	Here **hand** is a metaphor meaning power, control, or authority. As the overseer of the women, Hegai was responsible for the young women who lived in the harem for virgins. Alternate translation: “under the custody of Hegai” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EST	2	3	w1ly	translate-unknown	תַּמְרוּקֵי⁠הֶֽן	1	their ointments	This term seems to refer to a specific substance that women would put on their face or other parts of their body to make themselves more beautiful. From verse 12, it appears to mean lotions that were used along with oils and perfumes. But here, this one aspect of a woman’s beauty treatment seems to be used to refer to all of it, so you could call these “beauty treatments.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]]) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

EST	2	4	lh3n	bita-hq	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י	1	in the eyes of	Here **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “The king found their suggestion appealing” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Jair, Shimei, and Kish are Mordecai’s male ancestors. You could say, “Mordecai was the son of Jair, who was the son of Shimei, who was the son of Kish,” or, “His father was named Jair, his grandfather was named Shimei, and his great-grandfather was named Kish.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	2	5	kw5t		אִ֥ישׁ יְמִינִֽי	1	a man, a Benjamite	While this likely refers to Kish, it is necessarily also true of Mordecai, and you could put it second in the verse.

You should introduce this by saying something like, “Many years earlier.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EST	2	6	z7fe	figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הָגְלָה֙ מִ⁠יר֣וּשָׁלַ֔יִם	1	who had been exiled from Jerusalem	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action.

EST	2	6	egm7	writing-background	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הָגְלָה֙ מִ⁠יר֣וּשָׁלַ֔יִם	1	who had been exiled from Jerusalem	You can bring this information forward from later in the verse because it provides background information that helps identify Mordecai. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EST	2	6	zxc7	figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הָגְלָה֙ מִ⁠יר֣וּשָׁלַ֔יִם	1	who had been exiled from Jerusalem	If it would be clearer in your language, you could say where King Nebuchadnezzar brought the people that he took away from Jerusalem.

That was another name by which he was known. You can call him Jehoiachin here in Esther if you think that would help your readers recognize him better. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Separately they could be saying that Esther was both sexually mature and very attractive. But taken together they mean that overall she was very pleasant to look at. You could combine them, as UST does, and say that she was “exceptionally attractive” Alternate translation: “she had a lovely body and a beautiful face.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

You can move it to right after the place where Esther is introduced by name, because it describes what happened in the past, before Esther became a beautiful young woman. Alternate translation: “After her father and her mother had died, Mordecai had adopted her as his own daughter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
EST	2	8	zxv9	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	So it happened that	After providing this background information about Mordecai and Esther in verses 5–7, the story now tells what happened as a result of these facts, when the provincial officers described in verse 3 began sending young women to the harem. That is, the story tells what happened to Esther because her family was living in the Persian empire and she was very attractive. You should indicate in some way that the events are now moving forward from where the story left off. For example, “And so this is what happened.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

It was so that he could ask people who were going in to or coming out of the courtyard how Esther was doing. You can put this first in the verse because it explains the rest of what is said, if that would be clearer in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

EST	2	12	jcj8	writing-background	וּ⁠בְ⁠הַגִּ֡יעַ	1	Now when…came	Verses 12 to 14 are background information about how the virgins who were gathered for the king became his concubines. These verses are not specifically about Esther, but about the women in general. Use a connecting word or a phrase such as “This is how virgins became concubines for the king” so that your readers will know that this is background information.(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

As the story has already explained, he would then choose one of them to become his queen and primary wife. But the king would still provide for each of the concubines for the rest of her life. They would not be free to marry anyone else. This is something that the story’s original audience would have understood implicitly. You can say it explicitly if your readers need this information to understand the story: “Each young woman in the harem, one at a time, was going to have sexual relations with King Ahasuerus and become one of his concubines” or “one of his secondary wives.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

In 2:3 and 2:9, this one specific part of the program seems to be used figuratively to mean all of it, and so in those verses it can be translated “beauty treatments.” But it should be translated with a specific term or phrase here, such as “women’s lotions” or “feminine ointments,” because it is named along with oils and perfumes as one component of the treatment. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

EST	2	14	abe8		לֹא־תָב֥וֹא עוֹד֙ אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	She would not go to the king again	Alternate translation: “She would not go and see the king again.” In verse 12, the Note mentioned that “go to the king” meant “have sexual relations with the king.” But for this occurrence of the expression, it is appropriate to use a phrase suggesting that there would be a larger social component to a further visit. The woman would now be a secondary wife, and the king would only send for her if he decided that he enjoyed being with her.
EST	2	14	abe9		חָפֵ֥ץ בָּ֛⁠הּ	1	had delighted in her	This means that he “had enjoyed being with her” or that she “had pleased the king very much.”

A contrast is being drawn. A young woman could take any clothing and jewelry she wanted from the harem. But Esther only asked for what Hegai recommended. So it would be good to introduce this episode with a word such as “but” that draws a contrast. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

By following his advice, Esther showed that she trusted Hegai. This is implicit information that you can make explicit if it would help the reader to understand the story. You might say, for example, as UST does: “Hegai knew the king’s preferences because he was his personal servant. Esther had come to trust Hegai and so she followed his advice.” This could go at the end of the verse, once again to preserve the flow of the contrast.

Another contrast is possibly being drawn. Even though Esther only asked for what Hegai recommended, everyone was still impressed by the way she looked. So you could use a word such as “nevertheless” or “still” that draws a contrast. On the other hand, perhaps people were just impressed with her simple beauty because she didn’t try to be gaudy. They may also have been impressed with Hegai’s skill with her ensemble. You can decide whether it would help your readers to suggest a contrast here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

In this context, the expression probably means that everyone who saw Esther dressed in the clothes she would wear for her visit to the king was very impressed with the way she looked.

EST	2	15	jd87	bita-hq	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֖י	1	in the eyes of	Here **eyes** is a metonym for seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment.

Alternate translation: “The young girl greatly pleased him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the dates will be different every year and the translation will not be quite accurate. So you may just want to give the Hebrew days and months. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

The information is given twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that Ahasuerus was completely convinced that Esther was the one he should make his queen. “More than all the virgins” basically duplicates the meaning of “more than all the women,” so, if this duplication would be confusing in your language, you don’t need to include both phrases (unless you want your translation to capture something of the Hebrew storytelling style). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

See how you translated similar phrases in 2:9 and 2:15. Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. In this context, it probably means that King Ahasuerus was very impressed with both Esther’s appearance and her personality. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

You can say this explicitly if it will help the readers to understand the story. He probably believed that having a large number of concubines was another thing that would show he was a great king. To do so, you could add: “because Ahasuerus decided that he would like to have more concubines.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

EST	2	21	abh1	bita-humanbehavior	וַ⁠יְבַקְשׁוּ֙	1	and they sought	Here **seeking** figuratively means actively trying to do something. Alternate translation: “they had planned” or “they had tried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

This would be used to kill a person by suspending them above the ground. This might mean (1) by impaling them, that is, by sticking a sharp point on one end of the pole through their body, or (2) by hanging them with a rope tied around the neck. So you could translate this as “a wooden pole” or “a gallows.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

EST	3	1	ptm4	figs-idiom	כִּסְא֔⁠וֹ	1	his seat of authority	Here **seat of authority** means Haman’s position or status in the Persian government. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	3	1	abi1	figs-abstractnouns	כִּסְא֔⁠וֹ	1	his seat of authority	You can translate the abstract noun “authority” by using a concrete noun for this whole phrase, for example, “position” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

The citadel, in turn, would represent everyone who served the king. So you could say just “all the king’s other servants.” However, this may also be a reference to the specific group of officials who were stationed at the gate, the way Mordecai was. Alternate translation: “the royal officials who were stationed at the palace gate.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	3	2	abi4	figs-explicit	וְ⁠כָל־עַבְדֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ…כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ לְ⁠הָמָ֔ן	1	all the servants of the king…were bowing down and prostrating themselves to Haman	The servants were required to do this whenever Haman walked by, as a way of honoring him. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	2	e25k	translate-symaction	כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙	1	were bowing down and prostrating themselves	This means that the other officials humbled themselves and lay flat on the ground before Haman.

EST	3	2	abi5	figs-doublet	כֹּרְעִ֤ים וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙	1	were bowing down and prostrating themselves	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize that the officials knew how important it was to obey the king’s command and honor Haman in this way. You could combine them as UST does and say something like “bow down all the way to the ground.” Alternate translation: “bowing and lying down on the ground” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	3	2	fg8v		וּ⁠מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִים֙ לְ⁠הָמָ֔ן	1	and prostrating themselves to Haman	This means bowing down all the way to the ground.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EST	3	2	abi6	figs-explicit	כִּי־כֵ֖ן צִוָּה־ל֣⁠וֹ	1	for thus the king had commanded concerning him	The king did this as a sign of Haman’s new position.

The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was against the king’s command, and how much determination it took for Mordecai to remain standing. You could combine these phrases as UST does and say, “But Mordecai refused to bow down to Haman.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai did not bow down or lie on the ground.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	3	2	abi8	figs-explicit	וּ⁠מָ֨רְדֳּכַ֔י לֹ֥א יִכְרַ֖ע וְ⁠לֹ֥א יִֽשְׁתַּחֲוֶֽה	1	But Mordecai would neither bow down nor would he prostrate himself	It appears that as a Jew, Mordecai considered it wrong to worship anyone other than Yahweh, and that he believed it would be worshipping Haman if he bowed down low to the ground to honor him. So he refused to bow down, on religious grounds. You can say this explicitly if it would make your translation clearer. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	3	abi9		עַבְדֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	the servants of the king who were at the gate of the king	See how you translated this expression at the beginning of verse 2.

You can say this explicitly if that would be clearer in your language, for example, “The other officials saw that, and they asked Mordecai.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	3	abj1		מַדּ֨וּעַ֙ אַתָּ֣ה עוֹבֵ֔ר אֵ֖ת מִצְוַ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Why are you trespassing the command of the king?	“Why are you disobeying the king’s command?” or “Why are you not obeying what the king commanded?”
EST	3	4	jd3r	figs-explicit	ב⁠אמר⁠ם אֵלָי⁠ו֙	1	when they spoke to him	This means that they spoke to him about not bowing down. Specifically, they warned him that he would be severely punished if he kept disobeying the king and not honoring his highest official. You can say that explicitly if it would be clearer in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

This phrase means that the other officials “told Haman about it, to see if he would tolerate it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	3	4	abj3	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥יד לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא יְהוּדִֽי	1	for he had told them that he was a Jew	This is the answer that Mordecai gave the other officials when they asked him why he refused to bow down to Haman. You can put it first in the verse if that would be clearer in your language, because it explains everything that happens afterwards. Alternate translation: “Mordecai told them that he was a Jew, and that Jews would bow down only to God.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EST	3	4	abj4	figs-explicit	כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥יד לָ⁠הֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁר־ה֥וּא יְהוּדִֽי	1	for he had told them that he was a Jew	Mordecai’s explanation would have included the fact that Jews would only worship Yahweh.

The repetition is used to emphasize how serious an offense this was. You could combine them as UST does and say that “Mordecai was refusing to bow down to him.” Alternate translation: “Mordecai would not bow down or lie on the ground.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	3	5	wk8p	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּמָּלֵ֥א הָמָ֖ן חֵמָֽה	1	And Haman was filled with rage	Here Haman’s rage is spoken of as something that could fill him up. You could say that he was “furious” or “extremely angry.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	3	6	k5h9	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	And it was despised in his eyes	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate Translation: “Haman considered that it was not enough” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	3	6	abj6	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	And it was despised in his eyes	Haman probably decided to go to such extremes because he was so angry. You could say that explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	6	abj7		וַ⁠יִּ֣בֶז	1	it was despised	**Despise** in this context means not to hate but to “think little of.” This expression means that Haman decided it would not be enough just to kill Mordecai himself.
EST	3	6	jd9r	bita-hq	בְּ⁠עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	in his eyes	Here **eyes** stand for “seeing,” and in this case “seeing” figuratively means judgment. This phrase means “in Haman’s judgment.” Alternate translation: “as he saw it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	3	6	abj8		לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֤ח יָד֙ בְּ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֣י לְ⁠בַדּ֔⁠וֹ	1	to stretch out a hand against Mordecai alone	Alternate translation: “he rejected the idea of killing only Mordecai” or “he decided to kill more than just Mordecai” or “he decided that it would not be enough to get rid of only Mordecai.”
EST	3	6	j11r	figs-idiom	לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֤ח יָד֙	1	to stretch out a hand	As in 2:21, the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	3	6	abj9		כִּֽי־הִגִּ֥ידוּ ל֖⁠וֹ אֶת־עַ֣ם מָרְדֳּכָ֑י	1	for they had told him the people of Mordecai	**They** means the other royal officials. **Him** refers to Haman. “The people of Mordecai” means the Jews. Mordecai had told these officials that he would not bow down to Haman because Jews worshipped only God. So this means that the other officials had told Haman that Mordecai was not bowing down to him because he was a Jew.

EST	3	7	abk2	translate-unknown	חֹ֣דֶשׁ נִיסָ֔ן	1	the month of Nisan	As in 2:16, you could convert the Hebrew month into an approximate time on the calendar that your culture uses. However, the Jews used a lunar calendar, so if you use a solar calendar, the dates will be different every year and the translation will not be quite accurate. So you may just want to give the Hebrew month. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	3	7	tw99	translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁנַת֙ שְׁתֵּ֣ים עֶשְׂרֵ֔ה לַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵר֑וֹשׁ	1	in the twelfth year of the king Ahasuerus	Alternate translations: “during the twelfth year of the reign of Ahasuerus as king of Persia” or “when King Ahasuerus had reigned for about twelve years” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EST	3	7	g4lt	translate-names	הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩ ה֨וּא הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֜ל	1	a Pur (which is "the lot")	The storyteller is giving both the Persian and the Hebrew name because this is the story behind the Festival of Purim, which takes its name from “Pur.” So this is not repetition for emphasis. You can put in the Persian name and the name for “lot” in your own language to show that the storyteller is doing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	3	7	abk3	translate-unknown	הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֜ל	1	the lot	A “lot” was an object with different markings on various sides that was used, most likely by dropping it on the ground, to select a specific time for doing something. The belief was that God or the gods would control which way the object fell to guide the selection process and favor the action if it were done on the date chosen. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	3	7	abk4	figs-activepassive	הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩	1	a Pur…was cast	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action, for example, “Haman had his servants cast a Pur” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	3	7	abk5	grammar-connect-logic-result	הִפִּ֣יל פּוּר֩	1	a Pur…was cast	You can put this information first if that would be clearer in your language, because it explains the rest of what happens in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EST	3	7	j13r	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הָמָ֗ן	1	before the face of Haman	Here **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. In this context, the phrase means that Haman was physically present when the lot was cast. Alternate translation: “as Haman watched” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	3	7	j15r		מִ⁠יּ֧וֹם ׀ לְ⁠י֛וֹם וּ⁠מֵ⁠חֹ֛דֶשׁ לְ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ	1	from day to day and from month to month	This expression means that the lot was cast to select a particular day of the month and a particular month of the year.
EST	3	7	j17r	figs-explicit	מִ⁠יּ֧וֹם ׀ לְ⁠י֛וֹם וּ⁠מֵ⁠חֹ֛דֶשׁ לְ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ	1	from day to day and from month to month	Haman was casting the lot to determine the best day and the best month to kill the Jews. You can say that explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate Translation: “To determine the best day and the best month to kill the Jews.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	7	ih4b	translate-hebrewmonths	שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר	1	the twelfth, which is the month of Adar	“Adar” is the name of the twelfth and last month of the Hebrew calendar. This name occurs several times in the story. Be sure to translate it consistently. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	3	7	abk6		שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר	1	the twelfth, which is the month of Adar	See how you decided in 2:16 and the first part of this verse to represent the dates that are given in the Hebrew calendar in the book of Esther.
EST	3	7	abk7	figs-explicit	שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר	1	the twelfth, which is the month of Adar	This means that the lot indicated the twelfth month of that year as the time for Haman to carry out his plan. You can say that explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. (The day that was chosen is reported in verse 13.) Alternate Translation: “the lot indicated the twelfth month, the month of Adar, as the best month to kill the Jews.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	7	k3vd	translate-ordinal	שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר	1	the twelfth	Alternative translation: “month twelve” or “the twelfth month” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

You could say that explicitly. Do not give your readers the impression that the king was present with Haman while he was casting the lot. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	8	aig9	translate-numbers	יֶשְׁנ֣⁠וֹ עַם־אֶחָ֗ד	1	He has one people	**He** refers to the king, and **one people** refers to the Jews as a people group. So this means “there is a people group” or “a group of people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EST	3	8	p4a8	figs-doublet	מְפֻזָּ֤ר וּ⁠מְפֹרָד֙	1	scattered and dispersed	These two words mean almost the same thing. Haman uses the repetition to emphasize that the Jews are everywhere throughout the empire and so their influence, which he says is bad, will affect everyone. You could combine these words as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

Haman is saying that the Jews have their own set of laws, and he is accusing them of not obeying the king’s laws as a result.
EST	3	8	r34x	figs-123person	דָּתֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	the laws of the king	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You could have him say “your laws.” Or you could indicate this respect another way by having Haman begin by saying, “Your Majesty.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	3	8	bf9g	figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ אֵין־שֹׁוֶ֖ה לְ⁠הַנִּיחָֽ⁠ם	1	And there is no profit to the king to leave them untouched	Haman is saying, “It is not good for you to allow them to live in your empire.” This can also be stated in positive form. Alternate translation: “the king should remove them” or “you should remove them”
EST	3	8	j19r	figs-123person	וְ⁠לַ⁠מֶּ֥לֶךְ	1	no profit to the king	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You could express the same meaning in the second person: “not good for you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	3	9	abl1	figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	Haman speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	3	9	abl2	figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ ט֔וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	See how you decided to translate this idiom in 1:19. Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king” or “If the king thinks this is a good idea” or “If this advice is pleasing to the king.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	3	9	abl3	figs-activepassive	יִכָּתֵ֖ב	1	let it be written	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who would do the action, for example, “the king could write a decree” or “you could write a decree.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	3	9	abl4		לְ⁠אַבְּדָ֑⁠ם	1	to destroy them	This means that the decree would say that all the Jews should be killed.
EST	3	9	eh3w	figs-idiom	אֶשְׁקוֹל֙ עַל־יְדֵי֙ עֹשֵׂ֣י הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה	1	I will weigh out…into the hands of the doers of the work	This could mean either of two possibilities: (1) “weigh out into the hands” could be an idiom that means Haman himself will pay the officers who will put the plan into effect. Haman will not do this personally, but it means that he will take responsibility for paying them from his own resources. Alternate translation: “I will pay … the men who do the work from my own resources.” (2) Haman could mean that these officers will be able to collect a huge amount of money from the plunder they get from the Jews. Referring to the weight would be a way of saying “I guarantee that it will be at least that much.” In 3:13, the king’s letter specifies that those who kill the Jews can take their plunder. Alternate translation: “we will get so much plunder that the officers you send will be able to bring back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	3	9	lhv5	translate-bmoney	⁠עֲשֶׂ֨רֶת אֲלָפִ֜ים כִּכַּר־כֶּ֗סֶף	1	10,000 talents of silver	This would be worth over $300 million at current prices. But since prices vary over time, if you expressed the amount in modern measurements, that could cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate. Instead you could express the amount using the ancient measurement, the talent, and explain in a note that a talent was equivalent to about 30 kilograms. Alternatively, you could specify the weight of the silver in the text, as UST does. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EST	3	9	abl5		עֹשֵׂ֣י הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֔ה	1	the doers of the work	This means the officers whom Ahasuerus would send around the empire to organize the killing of the Jews.
EST	3	9	abl6		לְ⁠הָבִ֖יא אֶל־גִּנְזֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	to bring into the treasuries of the king	This could mean either of two possibilities: (1) This could be indicating that when Haman says he will put the money into the hands of the officers who carry out his plan, he actually means that he will put the money in the royal treasury so that it can be paid out to them. Or, (2) Haman could be saying that all the plunder from the Jews can be brought into the royal treasuries, and that will make the king even richer.
EST	3	9	abl7	figs-123person	גִּנְזֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	the treasuries of the king	Haman speaks to the king in third person as a form of respect. You could also have him speak of “your royal treasuries” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

You could say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The king agreed that this was a good idea, so.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	3	10	abl9	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יָּ֧סַר הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ אֶת־טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל יָד֑⁠וֹ וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֗⁠הּ לְ⁠הָמָ֧ן	1	Then the king removed his signet ring from on his hand	Giving the ring to Haman showed that Haman could act on the king’s own authority. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The king gave Haman the power to act on his authority to carry out the plan. To show that, he gave Haman the ring he wore that had his official seal on it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EST	3	10	c9md	translate-unknown	טַבַּעְתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	his signet ring	This was a special ring that could be used to imprint the king’s official seal on a law or decree. This ring had the king’s name or mark on it. When he put a wax seal on important papers, he would press the mark onto the seal. If a paper had this mark on its seal, people would know that what was written on the paper was written with the king’s authority and had to be obeyed. You could describe this as “the ring he wore that had his official seal on it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	3	10	abm0		בֶּֽן־הַמְּדָ֛תָא הָ⁠אֲגָגִ֖י	1	the son of Hammedatha the Agagite	This information about Haman’s identity is repeated to stress that the king giving him the signet ring was an official legal act that transferred power to him. (In the same way, legal documents today often use a person’s full name and other identifying information.) If you repeat this information in your own translation, your readers should see this significance.
EST	3	10	abm1	figs-informremind	צֹרֵ֥ר הַ⁠יְּהוּדִֽים	1	the adversary of the Jews	This phrase gives clarifying information about Haman. It means that he had become “the enemy of the Jews.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EST	3	11	sz4b	figs-activepassive	הַ⁠כֶּ֖סֶף נָת֣וּן לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	The silver is given to you	You can say this with an active form. This could mean a number of different things: (1) “You can keep the plunder for yourself.” (2) “I will return the money to you,” that is, “I will pay you back after the plan is carried out.” (3) “Take the money and give it to the men just as you have said.” (4) “You do not need to pay for the expenses of the plan yourself.” (5) This statement by the king may also be a formal and cultural way of expressing gratitude for the promised money, without actually releasing Haman from paying the money into the treasury. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	3	11	abm2	bita-hq	וְ⁠הָ⁠עָ֕ם לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת בּ֖⁠וֹ כַּ⁠טּ֥וֹב בְּ⁠עֵינֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	and the people, to do with them as is good in your eyes	Here **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. The king is telling Haman that he can do whatever he wants to the Jews. Alternate translation: “You can do to the Jews as you see fit.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	3	12	hx6c	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּקָּרְאוּ֩ סֹפְרֵ֨י הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	And the scribes of the king were called	You can say this with an active form. You can also say who did the action. It was most likely Haman, since the king had given him authority to act on his behalf. So you could say, “Haman called in the royal scribes.” Alternate translation: “the king summoned his scribes.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	3	12	t6qa	translate-hebrewmonths	בַּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֗וֹן בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֨ה עָשָׂ֣ר יוֹם֮ בּ⁠וֹ֒	1	in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it	Alternate translation: “on the thirteenth day of the first month.” You can add “of that same year” to show that Haman did this right after Ahasuerus agreed to his plan. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EST	3	12	abm3		בַּ⁠חֹ֣דֶשׁ הָ⁠רִאשׁ֗וֹן בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֨ה עָשָׂ֣ר יוֹם֮ בּ⁠וֹ֒	1	in the first month, on the thirteenth day of it	You can put this information first because it places the event within the timeline of the story.

EST	3	12	abm8	figs-explicit	מְדִינָ֤ה וּ⁠מְדִינָה֙ כִּ⁠כְתָבָ֔⁠הּ	1	province by province according to its writing	The implication is that the scribes translated the letter and sent it to each province using its own alphabet.

EST	3	12	j31r	figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַ֥ם וָ⁠עָ֖ם כִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	and to people by people according to its own tongue	See how you translated this expression in 1:22. Alternate translation: “and to each people group in its own language.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	3	12	j33r	bita-hq	כִּ⁠לְשׁוֹנ֑⁠וֹ	1	according to its tongue	Here **tongue** is a metonym meaning the language spoken by a person or a group of people. Alternate translation: “according to its language” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	3	12	abm9	figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֨ם הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֹשׁ֙ נִכְתָּ֔ב	1	In the name of the king Ahasuerus it was written	(1) Here **name** could mean the authority of the king. This would be saying that Haman’s letter had the same authority as it would have had if the king had sent it himself. Alternate translation: “Haman sent the letter under the king's own authority.” (2) However, this could also mean that Haman actually had the scribes sign the king’s name to the letter. Alternate translation: “They signed the king's name at the end of the letters.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Alternate translation: “To show that he was sending the letter under the king's own authority, Haman sealed each copy of the letter with the ring that had the king’s official seal on it,” or, “The scribes signed the king's name at the end of the letters. Then they sealed the letters with wax, and stamped the wax by using the king's ring.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

EST	3	13	j34r	bita-hq	בְּ⁠יַ֣ד הָ⁠רָצִים֮	1	by the hand of runners	Here **hand** could mean two different things. (1) It could literally mean “hand,” meaning that the couriers carried the letters in their hands. Alternate translation: “Couriers hand-delivered the documents.” (2) “Hand” could also be a metaphor for power, control, or authority, meaning that couriers were the ones who delivered the letters to all the provinces throughout the empire. Alternate translation: “couriers gave the documents directly” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	3	13	abn0	figs-metonymy	אֶל־כָּל־מְדִינ֣וֹת הַ⁠מֶּלֶךְ֒	1	to all of the provinces of the king	Haman did not send the letters to the provinces (the geographical territories) themselves. Rather, he sent them to the officials in every province in the empire. The story is using the word “province” to refer figuratively to these officials by something associated with them, the territories they ruled. Your translation should make clear that the letters were sent to people, not places. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	3	13	xs6g	figs-doublet	לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֡יד לַ⁠הֲרֹ֣ג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֣ד	1	to annihilate, to slaughter, and to destroy	These words mean the same thing. They are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction that is envisioned. You could combine them as UST does and say something like “completely destroy.” (A “doublet” can use more than two words. See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	3	13	abn1	figs-merism	מִ⁠נַּ֨עַר וְ⁠עַד־זָקֵ֜ן	1	from young even to old	This is a figure of speech that figuratively describes all of something by naming two extreme parts of it in order to include everything in between. You could express its meaning as UST does and say something like “every single one of them.” Alternate translation: “including young people and old people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])
EST	3	13	abn2		טַ֤ף וְ⁠נָשִׁים֙	1	children and women	“including the children and the women”

EST	3	14	f6dc		לִ⁠הְי֥וֹת עֲתִדִ֖ים לַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	to be ready for this day	Alternate translations: “so that people would be ready to do on that day what the king had written in the letter” or “so that they would get ready to do what the letter said when the day came”

EST	3	15	abn6	figs-synecdoche	יָשְׁב֣וּ לִ⁠שְׁתּ֔וֹת	1	sat down to drink	(1) This could mean that Ahasuerus and Haman had more than just a drink together. This could be a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to mean the whole thing. They may have celebrated with an entire banquet that is being described here by reference to one part of it, the drinks. Alternate translation: “had a celebration feast together.” (2) Another possibility is that this is describing a toast that Ahasuerus and Haman shared to celebrate their plan. “Sat down” would simply be describing how the men would have reclined at a table to drink. Alternate translation: “had a celebration toast” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

Or he may have wanted to contact Esther and ask her to help with the trouble. Or both.

In both cases, “this” refers to what Mordecai was doing. The repetition is used to emphasize that Esther now knew there must be a very serious reason why Mordecai was wearing sackcloth in such a public place. Alternate translation: “to find out why he was so distressed that he was sitting at the palace gate wearing sackcloth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])

They are repeated to emphasize how important Mordecai knew it was for Esther to understand just what Haman was planning. “He told Hathak to show the letter to Esther so that she would know exactly what it said.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	4	8	abq2		וּ⁠לְ⁠צַוּ֣וֹת עָלֶ֗י⁠הָ	1	and to lay a charge upon her	“and to urge her”

In this context, the phrase means that Esther should go into the presence of the king to ask personally for the king’s intervention. Alternate translation: “to go to the king personally” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

So this phrase means something like “those both near and far.” Esther is using a figure of speech to refer to something by speaking of two extreme parts of it in order to include everything in between those parts. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases and say something like, “everyone in the whole empire knows.” Alternate translation: “All the king's officials and all the people in the empire know this law.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-merism]])

You can put this information after the description of the law itself, if that would be clearer in your language, so that it can serve to emphasize how definite the law is that was just described.
EST	4	11	d9mh	figs-merism	כָּל־אִ֣ישׁ וְ⁠אִשָּׁ֡ה אֲשֶׁ֣ר	1	for any man or woman	Here Esther once again refers to something figuratively by describing two parts of it.

He could see out of the entrance to the room into the courtyard and tell if anyone came and stood there. Anyone who did that was asking to speak to the king. Alternate translation: “who goes into the inner courtyard of the palace, where the king can see them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

EST	4	11	abr3	translate-unknown	שַׁרְבִ֥יט הַ⁠זָּהָ֖ב	1	the scepter of gold	A scepter was an ornamental staff or wand that rulers carried or held as a symbol of their authority.

If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Alternate translation: “in over a month”

By doing this, her character became respected by the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	1	j53r	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֗י	1	Now it happened on the third day	This introduces a new event in the story. Alternate translation: “Three days later” or “When Esther had been fasting for three days” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EST	5	1	abs7	figs-abstractnouns	וַ⁠תִּלְבַּ֤שׁ אֶסְתֵּר֙ מַלְכ֔וּת	1	Esther put on royalty	You can use an adjective and a concrete noun to translate the abstract noun “royalty.” Alternate translation: “Esther put on her royal robes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	5	1	abs8	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּלְבַּ֤שׁ אֶסְתֵּר֙ מַלְכ֔וּת	1	Esther put on royalty	It’s clear from the story that before she went to see the king, Esther got a banquet ready so that she could invite him and Haman to come to it right away. You can explain that here. Alternate translation, add: “Esther prepared a grand banquet and then put on her royal robes” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	1	abs9		בַּ⁠חֲצַ֤ר בֵּית־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ הַ⁠פְּנִימִ֔ית	1	the inner court of the palace of the king	See how you translated this in 4:11. Alternate translation: “the inner courtyard of the palace”

You can translate this idea with a verb, “the throne he ruled from” and “the palace where he reigned,” or with an adjective, “his royal throne” and “his royal palace.” Alternate translation: “in the throne room of the palace, sitting on the throne” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

EST	5	2	j57r	figs-idiom	נָשְׂאָ֥ה חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו	1	she lifted favor in his eyes	See how you translated similar expressions in 2:9, 2:15, and 2:17. Review the explanations there if that would be helpful. In this context, it probably means that King Ahasuerus thought Esther looked very attractive as she stood in the court. It could also mean that King Ahasuerus was very pleased to see her. Or both. Alternate translation: “he was very pleased to see her” or “he approved of her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	5	2	pw4x	bita-hq	נָשְׂאָ֥ה חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו	1	she lifted favor in his eyes	Here **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. This phrase means that King Ahasuerus decided not to kill Esther for coming into the inner court without being summoned. Alternate translation: “he was very pleased to see her” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

See how you translated this in 4:11. Alternate translation: “he extended the gold scepter toward her.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “he extended the gold scepter toward her to signal that he would be glad to talk to her.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	2	abt4		וַ⁠תִּקְרַ֣ב	1	so…approached	“so…came close” or “so…came up to the throne”
EST	5	2	abt5	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּגַּ֖ע בְּ⁠רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠שַּׁרְבִֽיט	1	and touched the head of the scepter	This action was probably customary for a king’s subjects in a Persian court, when the king extended the royal scepter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	2	z4mn	translate-symaction	וַ⁠תִּגַּ֖ע בְּ⁠רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠שַּׁרְבִֽיט	1	and touched the head of the scepter	This action demonstrated that Esther respected the authority of King Ahasuerus and was thankful for his kindness to her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EST	5	2	j59r	bita-hq	בְּ⁠רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠שַּׁרְבִֽיט	1	the head of the scepter	Here **head** is a metonym meaning the top (or uppermost part) of an object or location. This phrase means that Esther touched the top of the king’s scepter on the end that was extended toward her. Alternate translation: “the top of the scepter” or “the tip of the scepter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	5	3	abt6		מַה־לָּ֖⁠ךְ אֶסְתֵּ֣ר הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֑ה	1	What is to you, Esther the queen?	“What do you want, Queen Esther?”

Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is very interested in hearing why Esther has come to see him. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if it would be more natural in your language to combine them into one. Alternate translation: “What do you want, Queen Esther?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	5	3	j61r	figs-hyperbole	עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠יִנָּ֥תֵֽן לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	As much as half of the kingdom, and let it be given to you	This was probably a formal and customary expression in the Persian royal court, meant to show honor to the person making a request of the king and to indicate the king’s willingness to be very generous when answering the request. King Ahasuerus was almost certainly not offering to give Esther half of his kingdom. If it would be clearer to your readers, you could express the meaning: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is.” Alternate translation: “I will give you what you want, even if you ask me to give you half of my kingdom!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EST	5	3	c6h7	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יִנָּ֥תֵֽן לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	and let it be given to you	You can say this with an active form, and you can say who will do the action. Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for” or “I will give you what you want” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	5	4	abt8	figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in 1:19 and 3:9. Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	5	4	m3uy	figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	5	4	j63r	figs-123person	יָב֨וֹא הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ וְ⁠הָמָן֙	1	let the king come with Haman	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “O king, please come with Haman” or “you and Haman come” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	5	4	abt9	figs-123person	הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֥יתִי לֽ⁠וֹ	1	the banquet that I have made for him	Esther speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. Alternate translation: “the banquet that I have prepared for you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	5	4	abu0	figs-yousingular	הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־עָשִׂ֥יתִי לֽ⁠וֹ	1	the banquet that I have made for him	If you decide to translate this as “the banquet that I have prepared for you,” then the word “you” should be singular, since here it refers just to the king. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
EST	5	5	abu1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Then the king said	The king would have said this to his servants, not to Esther. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The king said to his servants” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	5	abu2		מַהֲרוּ֙ אֶת־הָמָ֔ן לַ⁠עֲשׂ֖וֹת אֶת־דְּבַ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֑ר	1	Bring Haman quickly, in order to do the word of Esther	The **word of Esther** means her invitation to the banquet. Alternate translation: “Go and get Haman and bring him quickly to the banquet that Esther has prepared”
EST	5	5	abu3		עָשְׂתָ֥ה	1	had made	“had prepared for them”
EST	5	6	abu4		בְּ⁠מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה הַ⁠יַּ֔יִן	1	during the banquet of wine	“while they were drinking wine”

And what is your request? As much as half of the kingdom, and let it be done.	These two statements mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is truly disposed to give Esther what she wants. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation. Alternate translation: “Now please tell me what you really want. I will do it for you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	5	6	pj3p	figs-explicit	מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֖⁠ךְ וְ⁠יִנָּ֣תֵֽן לָ֑⁠ךְ וּ⁠מַה־בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	What is your petition?	When Ahasuerus asked Esther in the throne room what she wanted, she said that she wanted him and Haman to come to a banquet she had prepared. But since the king asks her once again at the banquet what she wants, it is clear that he knew this was not her real request. Instead, he knew that she wanted to show him hospitality first, as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship. You can indicate this by translating, “Now please tell me what you really want.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	6	q5nt	figs-abstractnouns	שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֖⁠ךְ…בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ	1	your petition…your request	The two abstract nouns “petition” and “request” can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “what you really want” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	5	6	e2v2	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יִנָּ֣תֵֽן…וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	And let it be given to you…let it be done	You can capture these parallel passive statements with one statement using an active form. Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	5	6	j65r		עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת	1	As much as half of the kingdom	See how you translated this expression in 5:3. Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is.”
EST	5	7	abu5	figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠תַּ֥עַן…וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֑ר	1	Then…answered and said	Here a single idea is being expressed by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words mean that Esther responded to the question that the king asked her. Alternate translation: “answered” or “replied” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EST	5	7	r4aw	figs-doublet	שְׁאֵלָתִ֖⁠י וּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י	1	My petition and my request	The words “petition” and “request” mean the same thing. Esther probably used these words together as a way of speaking very formally and respectfully to the king. Alternate translation: “This is what I want” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	5	7	abu6	figs-abstractnouns	שְׁאֵלָתִ֖⁠י וּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י	1	My petition and my request	The two abstract nouns “petition” and “request” can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “This is what I want” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])

EST	5	8	abu7	bita-hq	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֜ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	if I have found favor in the eyes of the king	Here **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. The phrase means for King Ahasuerus to be pleased with Esther and so willing to grant her request. Alternate translation: Alternate translation: “if the king evaluates me and approves” or “if the king is pleased with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EST	5	8	abu8	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ ט֔וֹב	1	if it is good to the king	This is an idiom. See how you translated it in 1:19, 3:9, and 5:4. Alternate translation: “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
EST	5	8	abu9		וּ⁠מָחָ֥ר אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֖ה כִּ⁠דְבַ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	and tomorrow I will do according to the word of the king	The **word of the king** means his request for Esther to tell him what she wants. Alternate translation: “I will answer your question then”

EST	5	9	j73r	figs-doublet	שָׂמֵ֖חַ וְ⁠ט֣וֹב לֵ֑ב	1	joyful and good of heart	The word “joyful” and the phrase “good of heart” mean the same thing. These terms are used together to show that Haman was very happy after attending Esther’s banquet with King Ahasuerus. Alternate translation: “feeling very happy” [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]]
EST	5	9	j75r	bita-hq	וְ⁠ט֣וֹב לֵ֑ב	1	and good of heart	Here **heart** figuratively represents the action of thinking or feeling. The phrase means that Haman felt happy. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	5	9	dkg6	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹא־קָם֙	1	that he neither rose up	Under other circumstances, officials were expected to bow low to the ground to show respect for Haman. (See 3:2.) But since Mordecai was already sitting on the ground as a sign of mourning, he would have been expected to stand up to show respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Mordecai did not stand up to show respect for Haman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EST	5	9	j77r	translate-symaction	וְ⁠לֹא־זָ֣ע מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	nor trembled from him	The phrase means that Mordecai was not afraid of Haman or of what Haman might do to him for refusing to show the respect that the king had commanded.

EST	5	10	v5nl	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יִּתְאַפַּ֣ק הָמָ֔ן	1	But Haman restrained himself	There is a contrast between this sentence and the previous one. Haman felt very much like doing one thing, but he decided it would be better to do something else. The contrast can be indicated with a phrase such as “but even though.” Alternate translation: “But even though Haman was so angry, he kept himself from losing his temper” or “Haman refused to show how angry he was” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EST	5	10	abv2		וַ⁠יָּב֖וֹא אֶל־בֵּית֑⁠וֹ	1	and went to his house	“went home”

Alternate translation: “Haman told them about how great his wealth was” or “Haman told them about the many great things he owned” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	5	11	j79r	translate-symaction	וְ⁠רֹ֣ב בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	and the multitude of his sons	Having many sons was probably seen as a mark of honor and status in Persian culture. This phrase probably means that Haman was boasting about the status he enjoyed in Persian society. Alternate translation: “how many sons he had” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	11	abv5	figs-gendernotations	בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	his sons	This word can sometimes be used in Hebrew to mean both male and female children. However, here it clearly refers to male children, so you should translate it that way. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])

EST	5	12	abv7	figs-exclamations	אַ֣ף	1	In addition	Alternate translation: “And that is not all!” You can translate it as an exclamation because Haman believes he has saved the best for last and is now introducing what he considers to be his most recent significant honor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])

EST	5	13	abw0	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠כָל־זֶ֕ה אֵינֶ֥⁠נּוּ שֹׁוֶ֖ה לִ֑⁠י בְּ⁠כָל־עֵ֗ת אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֲנִ֤י רֹאֶה֙	1	But all of this is not equal for me to every time that I see	This is a figurative way of speaking. It is as if Haman is weighing his happiness on one side of a scale and his unhappiness on the other side. Haman is saying his happiness over all the honors he has received is still not greater than his unhappiness over seeing Mordecai fail to honor him, so on balance, he is unhappy. Alternate translation: “I still cannot be happy as long as I keep seeing” or “all of this does not make me happy” or “does not satisfy me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	5	13	wu84		וְ⁠כָל־זֶ֕ה	1	But all of this	Haman is continuing to speak here. You can show this by beginning with, “Then Haman said”
EST	5	13	abw1	figs-informremind	הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔י	1	the Jew	This phrase gives clarifying information about Mordecai. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
EST	5	13	abw2	figs-explicit	יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	sitting at the gate of the king	Haman could be referring to the way Mordecai has been refusing to stand up to honor him. Or he could be referring generally to the way Mordecai has never honored him (by either bowing or standing up) ever since he was appointed to a position in the king’s service and stationed at the gate. Either way, being reminded of this dishonor is the reason why Haman continues to be unhappy. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “sitting at the citadel gate and refusing to honor me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	13	abw3		בְּ⁠שַׁ֥עַר הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	the gate of the king	“the citadel gate”
EST	5	14	j81r		וְ⁠כָל־אֹֽהֲבָ֗י⁠ו	1	with all his friends	This means the friends whom Haman had invited to his home that day. Alternate translation: “his friends who were there”
EST	5	14	abw4		וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר ל⁠וֹ֩	1	Then…said to him	“suggested”
EST	5	14	abw5	figs-explicit	יַֽעֲשׂוּ	1	Let them make	You can say who would do the action. Alternate translation: “have your servants set up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	5	14	i2f3	bita-plants	עֵץ֮	1	a tree	See how you translated this in 2:23. Review the note there if that would be helpful. Be sure your translation is consistent in the chapters that follow. Alternate translation: “wooden pole” or “gallows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	5	14	k8zd	translate-bdistance	גָּבֹ֣הַּ חֲמִשִּׁ֣ים אַמָּה֒	1	50 cubits high	You can convert this to a modern measure. Alternate translation: “seventy-five feet high” or “twenty-three meters high” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EST	5	14	abw6		וּ⁠בַ⁠בֹּ֣קֶר	1	And in the morning	“then tomorrow morning”
EST	5	14	abw7		אֱמֹ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ וְ⁠יִתְל֤וּ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַי֙ עָלָ֔י⁠ו	1	say to the king, and let them hang Mordecai on it	While Haman’s servants would likely carry out the action, it would happen under Haman’s orders and perhaps under his supervision, so you can describe him as the one who does the action if that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: “tell the king that you want to impale [or hang] Mordecai on it”
EST	5	14	abw8	grammar-connect-logic-result	וּ⁠בֹֽא…אֶל הַ⁠מִּשְׁתֶּ֖ה שָׂמֵ֑חַ	1	Then go…to the banquet joyful	**Then** indicates more than a time sequence here. Zeresh and the friends are saying what the result would be. Alternate translation: “Once you have executed him, you will be able to go to the banquet … in a good mood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EST	5	14	bbs9	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּיטַ֧ב הַ⁠דָּבָ֛ר לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן	1	And the word was good before the face of Haman	The **word** was the suggestion that Zeresh and the friends made. Here **face** figuratively represents Haman himself by something associated with him, his face, which showed what he was thinking and feeling. Alternate translation: “Haman decided that he liked this idea” or “That idea pleased Haman very much” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	5	14	i8is		וַ⁠יַּ֥עַשׂ הָ⁠עֵֽץ	1	and he made the tree	Haman most likely did not do this personally. He ordered it to be done. Alternate translation: “he gave his servants orders to set up the pole” or “he told his servants to construct the gallows”
EST	5	14	j83r	bita-plants	הָ⁠עֵֽץ	1	the tree	You should translate this the same way you did earlier in the verse, “the pole” or “the gallows.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	6	intro	i9x7			0		# Esther 06 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter continues the story of Haman’s fall.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Approaching the king<br>It was not possible for a person to easily approach the king. Normally, access to him was very limited. There are several events in this chapter which show the layers of protection surrounding the king.
EST	6	1	j85r	writing-newevent	בַּ⁠לַּ֣יְלָה הַ⁠ה֔וּא	1	That night	This introduces a new event in the story. Use a natural way of introducing a new event in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EST	6	1	abw9	figs-personification	נָדְדָ֖ה שְׁנַ֣ת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	the sleep of the king fled away	Here **sleep** is spoken of as if it were a living thing that could flee away. Alternate translation: “the king was unable to sleep” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
EST	6	1	abx1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר לְ⁠הָבִ֞יא	1	And he said to bring	**He** means the king. The implication is that he told the young men who attended him to do this. Verses 3 and 5 indicate this. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. “So he told the young men who attended him to bring in” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	1	abx2		סֵ֤פֶר הַ⁠זִּכְרֹנוֹת֙ דִּבְרֵ֣י הַ⁠יָּמִ֔ים	1	the book of records of the events of days	This is equivalent to the expression “the book of the events of days” in 2:23. See how you translated that expression. Alternate translation: “the royal chronicles” or “the records of what had happened during all the time he had been king.”
EST	6	1	abx3		וַ⁠יִּהְי֥וּ נִקְרָאִ֖ים	1	they were being called out	This means that the chronicles were read out loud. You can say this with an active form, and you can say who did the action. Alternate translation: “The young men got the chronicles and began to read them out loud” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	6	1	j87r	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	before the face of the king	Here **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. This phrase means that the book was being read in the king’s presence. Alternate translation: “to the king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	6	2	u4gi	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּמָּצֵ֣א כָת֗וּב	1	And it was found written	Both terms **found** and **recorded** can be expressed in active form. Alternate translation: “They found that the writers had recorded there” or “They learned that the writers had written” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	6	2	abx4	figs-explicit	הִגִּ֨יד מָרְדֳּכַ֜י עַל	1	Mordecai had told about	The implication is that Mordecai had saved the king’s life by discovering the plot and telling him about it. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Mordecai had saved the king’s life by discovering a plot against the king and telling him about it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	2	abx5	figs-events	הִגִּ֨יד מָרְדֳּכַ֜י עַל	1	Mordecai had told about	To relate the events in chronological order, you can put this at the end of the verse. Alternate translation: “But Mordecai had saved the king’s life by discovering their plot and telling him about it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
EST	6	2	syd9	translate-names	בִּגְתָ֣נָא וָ⁠תֶ֗רֶשׁ	1	Bigthana and Teresh	These are the same two men who are named in 2:21. However, there the first man’s name is said to be “Bigthan.” Decide on a consistent way of translating these names so your readers will know that they are the same men. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	6	2	abx6	translate-unknown	שְׁנֵי֙ סָרִיסֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	two of the eunuchs of the king	See how you translated the term “eunuch” in 1:10. Alternate translation: “two of the royal guardians” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	6	2	abx7		מִ⁠שֹּׁמְרֵ֖י הַ⁠סַּ֑ף	1	who were from the guardians of the doorway	See how you translated this expression in 2:23. Alternate translation: “who protected the doorway to the king's private quarters”
EST	6	2	abx8	bita-humanbehavior	בִּקְשׁוּ֙	1	they had sought	Here **seeking** figuratively means actively trying to do something. Alternate translation: “they had planned” or “they had tried” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]] [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	2	j89r	figs-idiom	לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֣חַ יָ֔ד	1	to stretch out a hand	As in 2:21, the expression **to stretch out a hand** means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. Alternate translation: “to assassinate” or “to kill” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	6	3	abx9		וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	The the king said	“Then the king asked”
EST	6	3	lmz6	figs-doublet	מַֽה־נַּעֲשָׂ֞ה יְקָ֧ר וּ⁠גְדוּלָּ֛ה לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכַ֖י	1	What honor or great deed was done for Mordecai	**Honor** and **great deed** have similar meanings and they are used together emphasize that Mordecai should certainly have been honored in some way for saving the king’s life. If it would be clearer in your language, you can express this general meaning by saying something like, “What did I do to honor Mordecai?” Alternate translation: “What did we do to reward Mordecai or to show that we appreciated what he did?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	6	3	aby0	figs-activepassive	נַּעֲשָׂ֞ה	1	was done	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “What did I do” or “What did we do” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	6	3	aby1		עַל־זֶ֑ה	1	on account of this	“for saving my life”
EST	6	3	n2az	figs-activepassive	לֹא־נַעֲשָׂ֥ה עִמּ֖⁠וֹ דָּבָֽר	1	Not a thing has been done with him	You can say this with an active form. However, it would be good to say this in a way that does not create the impression that the young men are accusing the king. Alternate translation: “No one did anything for him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	6	4	aby2	figs-explicit	מִ֣י בֶ⁠חָצֵ֑ר	1	Who is in the court?	The implication is that King Ahasuerus wanted to consult somebody about the best way to honor Mordecai. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. The story has already said in 1:13 that it was the king's habit to consult his advisors on important questions. Alternate translation: “The king wanted to consult someone about the best way to honor Mordecai, so he asked, ‘Is anyone out in the courtyard?’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	4	aby3		מִ֣י בֶ⁠חָצֵ֑ר	1	Who is in the court?	In order to present the events in logical and chronological order, you can put the king’s question last in the verse if that would be more natural in your language. Haman had already come in the courtyard by the time the king asked this question.
EST	6	4	guv8		בֶ⁠חָצֵ֑ר	1	in the court	“courtyard”
EST	6	4	j91r	writing-background	וְ⁠הָמָ֣ן בָּ֗א לַ⁠חֲצַ֤ר בֵּית־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ הַ⁠חִ֣יצוֹנָ֔ה לֵ⁠אמֹ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ לִ⁠תְלוֹת֙ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַ֔י עַל־הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ אֲשֶׁר־הֵכִ֥ין לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Now Haman had come into the outer court of the house of the king to say to the king to hang Mordecai on the tree that he had prepared for him	This sentence indicates that Haman had already entered the outer court when King Ahasuerus asked his question. You could indicate this with a phrase such as “at that moment” or “just then” or “while they were talking” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-orderHeb]])
EST	6	4	rg8t		לַ⁠חֲצַ֤ר בֵּית־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ הַ⁠חִ֣יצוֹנָ֔ה	1	to the outer court of the house of the king	Alternate translation: “the outer courtyard of the palace.” This phrase is describing the first courtyard a person would come to after entering the palace from the outside.
EST	6	4	vu7p		לֵ⁠אמֹ֣ר לַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ לִ⁠תְלוֹת֙ אֶֽת־מָרְדֳּכַ֔י עַל־הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	to say to the king to hang Mordecai	“to tell the king that he wanted to hang Mordecai” or “to tell the king that he wanted to impale Mordecai”
EST	6	4	at53		הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ אֲשֶׁר־הֵכִ֥ין לֽ⁠וֹ	1	the tree that he had prepared for him	“on the pole that he had set up” or “on the gallows that he had set up”
EST	6	4	aby4	bita-plants	הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	the tree	See how you translated this term in 2:23 and 5:14. Review the note to 2:23 if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “pole” or “gallows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	6	5	aby5	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמְר֜וּ נַעֲרֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	And the young men of the king said	It is implied that the young men went and looked, perhaps through a window or a doorway, to see who might be in the courtyard before they answered the king. You can say that if it would make the translation clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “the young men who served the king looked and saw that Haman was in the courtyard. They said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	5	j93r		הִנֵּ֥ה	1	Behold	This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation. You could also have the young men address the king directly to get his attention. Alternate translation: “O king”
EST	6	5	j95r		יָבֽוֹא	1	Let him come	“Bring him in”
EST	6	6	j97r		וַ⁠יָּבוֹא֮ הָמָן֒ וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר ל⁠וֹ֙ הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Then Haman came, and the king said to him	“When Haman came in, the king said”
EST	6	6	ky5i	figs-123person	מַה־לַ⁠עֲשׂ֕וֹת בָּ⁠אִ֕ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֣ץ בִּ⁠יקָר֑⁠וֹ	1	What is one to do for the man in whose honor the king is delighted?	Here the king speaks of himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use the first person instead. Alternate translation: “What should I do for the man whom I would really like to honor?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	6	6	n3r5	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֣ץ בִּ⁠יקָר֑⁠וֹ	1	in whose honor the king is delighted	To delight in doing something means to be glad to do it and to really want to do it. Alternate translation: “whom I am glad to honor” or “whom I want to honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	6	6	jh4i	bita-hq	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר הָמָן֙ בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Then Haman said in his heart	Here **heart** could mean two different things. 1) “Heart” could figuratively represent the action of thinking or feeling. In that case, the phrase would mean, “Then Haman said in his thoughts.” 2) “Heart” could also be a metaphor meaning to “be inside” someone or something. In that case, the phrase would mean, “Then Haman said inside himself.” But either way, the phrase means that Haman was not saying this out loud, but saying it to himself in his thoughts. Alternate translation: “Haman thought to himself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	6	yft1	figs-rquestion	לְ⁠מִ֞י יַחְפֹּ֥ץ הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת יְקָ֖ר יוֹתֵ֥ר מִמֶּֽ⁠נִּי	1	For whom would the king delight to do honor more than me	Haman is actually making a statement to himself rather than asking a question and trying to figure out the answer. He uses a question form to emphasize how true he believes the statement to be. If it would be clearer in your language, instead of a question you could use a statement such as, “Surely there is no one whom the king would take pleasure in honoring more than me!” Alternate translation: “Whom would the king like to honor more than me?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EST	6	7	j1d1	figs-idiom	אִ֕ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֥ץ בִּ⁠יקָרֽ⁠וֹ	1	For a man in whose honor the king is delighted	To delight in doing something means to be glad to do it and to really want to do it. Alternate translation: “for a man the king is glad to honor” or “for a man the king wants to honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	6	7	aby6	figs-123person	אִ֕ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֥ץ בִּ⁠יקָרֽ⁠וֹ	1	For a man in whose honor the king is delighted	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You can have him address the king in the second person. Alternate translation: “If you really want to honor someone” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	6	8	mz79	figs-explicit	יָבִ֨יאוּ֙	1	let them bring	The implication is that the king’s servants would do this. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “let someone bring” or “tell your servants to bring” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	8	aby7	figs-abstractnouns	לְב֣וּשׁ מַלְכ֔וּת אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָֽבַשׁ־בּ֖⁠וֹ הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	a garment of royalty with which the king has clothed himself	**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate this idea with an adjective, “a royal garment.” Alternate translation: “one of your own royal robes that you have already worn yourself” or “one of the robes you wear to show that you are the king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	6	8	aby8	figs-123person	אֲשֶׁ֥ר לָֽבַשׁ־בּ֖⁠וֹ הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	with which the king has clothed himself	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You can have him address the king in the second person. Alternate translation: “that you have already worn yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	6	8	aby9	figs-123person	וְ⁠ס֗וּס אֲשֶׁ֨ר רָכַ֤ב עָלָי⁠ו֙	1	and a horse on which the king has ridden	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. You can have him address the king in the second person. Alternate translation: “a horse that you have already ridden yourself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	6	8	r63j	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִתַּ֛ן כֶּ֥תֶר מַלְכ֖וּת בְּ⁠רֹאשֽׁ⁠וֹ	1	and which has been given a crown of royalty for its head	This whole phrase refers to the horse. You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “and that has a royal crown on its head” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	6	8	abz0	figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִתַּ֛ן כֶּ֥תֶר מַלְכ֖וּת בְּ⁠רֹאשֽׁ⁠וֹ	1	and which has been given a crown of royalty for its head	The implication is that this would be done to show that this was one of the king’s own horses. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and that has a royal crown on its head to show that it belongs to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	8	abz1	figs-abstractnouns	כֶּ֥תֶר מַלְכ֖וּת	1	a crown of royalty	**Royalty** is an abstract noun that refers to the royal authority that the king exercised. You can translate this idea with an adjective, “a royal crown.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	6	9	pp3l	bita-hq	וְ⁠נָת֨וֹן הַ⁠לְּב֜וּשׁ וְ⁠הַ⁠סּ֗וּס עַל־יַד־אִ֞ישׁ מִ⁠שָּׂרֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	Then give this garment and this horse into the hand of a man from the most noble officials of the king	Here **hand** is a metaphor meaning power, control, or authority. It appears that the king himself would not perform such acts of service to one of his subjects, even if he really wanted to honor that person. So Haman is saying that on behalf of the king, representing his authority and power, one of the king’s most noble officials should present the man with the robe and the horse. Alternate translation: “Then, on your behalf, have one of your most noble officials present the man with the robe and the horse.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	9	j1d3	figs-123person	אִ֞ישׁ מִ⁠שָּׂרֵ֤י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ הַֽ⁠פַּרְתְּמִ֔ים	1	a man from the most noble officials of the king	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use the second person. Alternate translation: “one of your most noble officials” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	9	pfz6	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הִלְבִּ֨ישׁוּ֙	1	And let them clothe	Since **them** is plural, it likely refers to the king’s servants. You can say this explicitly if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: “Have your servants clothe … with the robe” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	9	j1d5	figs-idiom	הָ⁠אִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֣ץ בִּֽ⁠יקָר֑⁠וֹ	1	the man in whose honor the king is delighted	To delight in doing something means to be glad to do something or to want to do something. Alternate translation: “the man whom you really want to honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	6	9	abz2	figs-123person	הָ⁠אִ֔ישׁ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ חָפֵ֣ץ בִּֽ⁠יקָר֑⁠וֹ	1	the man in whose honor the king is delighted	Haman speaks to the king in the third person as a sign of respect. If it would clearer in your language, you can use the second person. Alternate translation: “the man whom you really want to honor” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	6	9	abz3		וְ⁠הִרְכִּיבֻ֤⁠הוּ עַל־הַ⁠סּוּס֙	1	and cause him to ride on the horse	“Have them seat that man on the horse and then lead the horse”
EST	6	9	abz4		בִּ⁠רְח֣וֹב הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	in the open place of the city	This refers to a large, open space in the city, either the space that was in front of the palace (as in 4:6), or a space inside one of the city gates. In either case, this would have been a public area where people could gather, and so it was a place where a great number of people would have seen how the king was honoring Mordecai. Alternate translation: “through the public square of the city”
EST	6	9	qs3k		וְ⁠קָרְא֣וּ	1	and proclaim	“and tell the noble official and servants to proclaim” or “and have them shout out”
EST	6	9	j1d7	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנָ֔י⁠ו	1	before his face	Here **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase means that the servants were to shout out to the people in front of Mordecai, that is, the people who were in the path of his horse as it approached.

Alternate translation: “The king is doing this because he really wants to honor this man!” or “This is what the king does when he especially wants to honor someone!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	6	10	j2d1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ לְ⁠הָמָ֗ן	1	So the king said to Haman	The implication is that the king liked Haman’s suggestion. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “The king liked this idea, so he replied” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	10	abz5		כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר דִּבַּ֔רְתָּ וַֽ⁠עֲשֵׂה־כֵן֙	1	according to how you have spoken, and do thus	“be sure to do absolutely everything you have said” or “do just what you have suggested”

Alternate translation: “one of my servants, who is stationed at the gate to the palace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	6	10	abz7	figs-123person	הַ⁠יּוֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠שַׁ֣עַר הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	the man who sits at the gate of the king	Here the king speaks of himself in the third person. If it would be clearer in your language, you can use the first person. Alternate translation: “one of my servants, who is stationed at the gate to the palace” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	6	10	gln7	figs-metaphor	אַל־תַּפֵּ֣ל דָּבָ֔ר	1	Do not allow a word to fail	Here the action of letting **fall** is a metaphor meaning to leave out or leave unfulfilled. The phrase means that Haman must do absolutely everything that he said. Alternate translation: “Do not leave out anything that you suggested” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-part1]])
EST	6	10	abz8	figs-doublenegatives	אַל־תַּפֵּ֣ל דָּבָ֔ר	1	Do not allow a word to fail	This can be stated positively. Alternate translation: “Be sure to do absolutely everything that you have said” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
EST	6	11	abz9		וַ⁠יַּרְכִּיבֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ בִּ⁠רְח֣וֹב הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	and paraded him in the open place of the city	See how you translated these expressions in verse 9. Alternate translation: “seated him on the horse and then led the horse through the public square of the city”
EST	6	11	j2d5	bita-hq	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֣א לְ⁠פָנָ֔י⁠ו	1	called out before his face	Here **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase means that the servants were to shout out to the people in front Mordecai, that is, the people who were in the path of his horse as it approached. Alternate translation: “shouted out to everyone in front of him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

EST	6	12	uri5	translate-symaction	אָבֵ֖ל וַ⁠חֲפ֥וּי רֹֽאשׁ	1	mourning with a covering of head	People often covered their head to show that they were either extremely sad or ashamed.

EST	6	13	j3d1	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֨ר הָמָ֜ן	1	Then Haman recounted	The implication is that just as Haman gathered his friends together in 5:10 to boast of his status, now he gathered them together once again to talk about what had just happened. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Haman gathered his friends together once again. He told…” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	13	aca1	figs-explicit	כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר קָרָ֑⁠הוּ	1	everything that had happened to him	The implication is, he told about the things that had happened to him “that day.” If that would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	6	13	aca2	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֩אמְרוּ֩ ל֨⁠וֹ חֲכָמָ֜י⁠ו וְ⁠זֶ֣רֶשׁ	1	Then his wise men and Zeresh said to him	The implication is that just as King Ahasuerus had royal advisors, Haman had advisors of his own. They would have been included among the “friends” he gathered for this occasion. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “Some of his friends were also his advisors, and they and his wife Zeresh told him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Haman wanted Mordecai to bow down in front of him. But instead, the story would be saying, Haman is starting to bow down (in a metaphorical sense) in front of Mordecai. Alternate translation: “Mordecai has begun to humiliate you. If he…” (2) “Fall” could be a figurative way of saying “be killed in battle.” In that case Zeresh would be comparing Haman and Mordecai to two soldiers who are fighting. She is saying that Haman has already “begun to fall,” that is, he is losing the battle, and he is likely to be killed. Alternate translation: “Mordecai has begun to defeat you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	13	j3d3	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙	1	before…face	Here **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase either means (1) that Haman has already begun to fall down (bow down) in front of Mordecai figuratively, or (2) that Haman and Mordecai are facing one another figuratively in hand-to-hand combat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	13	p5t2	bita-plants	מִ⁠זֶּ֣רַע הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֡ים	1	from the seed of the Jews	Here **seed** is a metaphor meaning “offspring.” It is a comparison: Just as plants produce seeds that grow into many more plants, so people can have many offspring. Alternate translation: “one of the Jewish people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	13	nan5	figs-metaphor	לֹא־תוּכַ֣ל ל֔⁠וֹ	1	you will not prevail against him	Here Haman’s wife and friends are again speaking figuratively as if Haman is in a battle with Mordecai. Alternate translation: “you will not win against him” or “you will not have greater honor than he has” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	13	j3d5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כִּֽי	1	but	This conjunction indicates a contrast between the actions of prevailing (in the previous clause) and falling. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
EST	6	13	j3d7	figs-metaphor	נָפ֥וֹל תִּפּ֖וֹל	1	you will surely fall	Here the action of **falling** (1) either refers once again to prostrating oneself, and is a metaphor meaning to be dishonored and defeated, or (2) Haman’s wife and friends are saying that defeat will be the outcome of the figurative battle for him. Alternate translation: “he will certainly defeat you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-part1]])
EST	6	13	j3d9	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנָֽי⁠ו	1	before his face	Here **face** figuratively represents the front of a person. The phrase either means (1) that Haman will figuratively fall down (bow down) entirely in front of Mordecai, or (2) that figuratively Mordecai will kill Haman in face-to-face combat. Alternate translation: “he will certainly defeat you”(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	6	14	j4d1	grammar-connect-time-background	עוֹדָ⁠ם֙ מְדַבְּרִ֣ים עִמּ֔⁠וֹ	1	They were still speaking with him when the eunuchs of the king arrived	This phrase indicates something that happened after Haman’s wife and friends started talking with Haman and while they were still talking. You should indicate this with a phrase such as “while.” Alternate translation: “While they were still talking together, the king’s eunuchs arrived.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
EST	6	14	aca4	translate-unknown	וְ⁠סָרִיסֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	when the eunuchs of the king	See how you decided to translate this term in 1:10. Alternate translation: “some of the royal guardians” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Esther hosted Ahasuerus and Haman for more than just drinks. This is a figure of speech in which a part of something is used to mean the whole thing. An entire banquet is being described here by reference to one part of it, the drinks. Alternate translation: “So the king and Haman went to the second banquet that Queen Esther had prepared.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EST	7	2	xt9f	translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֤וֹם הַ⁠שֵּׁנִי֙	1	on the second day	Alternate translation: “at that second banquet” or “on that second day of feasting” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

And what is your request? As much as half of the kingdom, and let it be done.	These two statements mean almost the same thing. Ahasuerus says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to show that he is truly disposed to give Esther what she wants. You do not need to repeat both phrases in your translation if that would be confusing for your readers. Alternate translation: “Now please tell me what you really want. Tell me, and I will do it for you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	7	2	p1xt	figs-explicit	מַה־שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ	1	What is your petition	Ahasuerus has now allowed Esther to show her hospitality at two banquets. But he knows that she has done this as a gesture of respect for him and their relationship, and that this signals that she has an important and urgent request to make. You can indicate this by having the king ask, “Now please tell me what you really want.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	7	2	sem7	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠תִנָּ֣תֵֽן…וְ⁠תֵעָֽשׂ	1	And let it be given to you…and let it be done	You can capture these parallel passive statements with one statement using an active form. Alternate translation: “I will give you what you ask for” or “I will do for you what you ask” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	7	2	j4d3	figs-abstractnouns	שְּׁאֵלָתֵ֛⁠ךְ…בַּקָּשָׁתֵ֛⁠ךְ	1	your petition…your request	The two abstract nouns “petition” and “request” can be expressed with a single phrase using the verb “want.” Alternate translation: “what you really want” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	7	2	j4d5	figs-hyperbole	עַד־חֲצִ֥י הַ⁠מַּלְכ֖וּת	1	As much as half of the kingdom	See how you translated this expression in 5:3 and 5:6. Alternate translation: “I will give you anything you ask for, no matter how great it is.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EST	7	3	ac96	figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠תַּ֨עַן…וַ⁠תֹּאמַ֔ר	1	Then…answered and said	Here a single idea is being expressed by using two words connected with “and.” Together the two words mean that Esther responded to the question that the king asked her. Alternate translation: “answered” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])
EST	7	3	k27c	figs-idiom	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	If I have found favor in your eyes	**Favor** means the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	7	3	aca7	bita-hq	אִם־מָצָ֨אתִי חֵ֤ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	If I have found favor in your eyes	Here **eyes** figuratively represent seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and approve” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	7	3	j4d7		הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	O king	In this case Esther is addressing Ahasuerus directly as “O king,” not speaking about him in the third person as a sign of respect, as she and others often do elsewhere in the story. So it would be good to include this phrase in your translation.
EST	7	3	aca8	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ ט֑וֹב	1	and if it is good to the king	This is an idiom that also appears in 1:19, 3:9, 5:4, and 5:8. The suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But here Esther has just addressed the king directly with “O king” and she is pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people. So an alternate translation here could be something more like, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	7	3	aca9	figs-parallelism	תִּנָּֽתֶן־לִ֤⁠י נַפְשִׁ⁠י֙ בִּ⁠שְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔⁠י וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י בְּ⁠בַקָּשָׁתִֽ⁠י	1	let my life be given to me at my petition, and my people at my request	These two phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the idea that they are expressing. You could combine them. Alternate translation: “Please spare my life, and save my people” or “my request is that you spare my life and the lives of my people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	7	3	j4d9	figs-activepassive	תִּנָּֽתֶן־לִ֤⁠י נַפְשִׁ⁠י֙	1	let my life be given to me	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “Please spare my life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	7	3	bvi1	figs-abstractnouns	בִּ⁠שְׁאֵ֣לָתִ֔⁠י	1	at my petition	The abstract noun “petition” can be expressed with the verb “ask for.” Alternate translation: “That is what I am asking for” or “That is what I want” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	7	3	acb0		וְ⁠עַמִּ֖⁠י	1	and my people	“and save my people”

EST	7	4	acb1	figs-metaphor	כִּ֤י נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙	1	For we have been sold	As Esther points out later in the verse, the Jews actually have not been exchanged for money. Rather, **sell** is a figurative way of saying “turn over to.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning by saying something like, “For someone has turned us over to our enemies” Alternatively, you could use the same figure, but show that it is a comparison. Alternate translation: “It is as though I and my people are cattle that have been sold to be slaughtered.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	7	4	fhs7	figs-activepassive	כִּ֤י נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙	1	For we have been sold	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “For someone has sold us” or “For someone has put us in danger of our enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	7	4	e9cx	figs-doublet	לְ⁠הַשְׁמִ֖יד לַ⁠הֲר֣וֹג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֑ד	1	for annihilation, for slaughter, and for destruction	As in 3:13, these words mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction. Alternate translation: “and they are going to destroy us completely” (A “doublet” can involve the use of more than two words.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	7	4	acb2		וְ֠⁠אִלּוּ לַ⁠עֲבָדִ֨ים וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁפָח֤וֹת נִמְכַּ֨רְנוּ֙	1	if we had been sold as slaves and female servants	“if the men and even the women had been sold into slavery”
EST	7	4	acb3		הֶחֱרַ֔שְׁתִּי	1	I would have kept silent	“I would not have said anything about that to you”
EST	7	4	j5d3	figs-hyperbole	אֵ֥ין הַ⁠צָּ֛ר שֹׁוֶ֖ה בְּ⁠נֵ֥זֶק הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	the distress would not have been equal to a burden of the king	Esther is speaking very deferentially and no doubt with some exaggeration. She is saying that it would have been worthless to her to see her people rescued from slavery than it would have been to see the king spared the trouble of intervening on their behalf. (Haman uses the expression of “not equal” in this same sense in 5:13.) Alternate translation: “that would have been a matter too small to bother you with” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
EST	7	4	acb4	figs-123person	הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	the king	Esther addresses King Ahasuerus in the third person as a way of showing respect. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	7	5	acb5		וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙…וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	Then…spoke and said	“responded”
EST	7	5	acb6	figs-parallelism	מִ֣י ה֥וּא זֶה֙ וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא	1	Who is he, this man? And where is this man	These two phrases mean similar things. They both ask about the identity of the man who is trying to destroy the Jews. King Ahasuerus uses the repetition to emphasize how outraged he is. If the repetition would be confusing in your language, you could combine the two phrases. However, from another perspective, both the man’s identity and his location are important to know so that his plot can be stopped. So, for that reason, you could also decide to include both phrases in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	7	5	acb7		מִ֣י ה֥וּא זֶה֙ וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא	1	Who is he, this man?	“Who has done this?”
EST	7	5	dl4b	bita-hq	וְ⁠אֵֽי־זֶ֣ה ה֔וּא אֲשֶׁר־מְלָא֥⁠וֹ לִבּ֖⁠וֹ לַ⁠עֲשׂ֥וֹת כֵּֽן	1	And where is this man, he whose heart is full to do thus?	Here the concept of a **full heart** uses two metaphors at once. “Heart” figuratively represents the action of thinking or feeling. Saying that the “heart” is “full” is a figurative way of saying that someone is daring to do something that should not be done. Alternate translation: “Where is the man who has dared to do such a thing?” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	7	6	j5d5	figs-doublet	אִ֚ישׁ צַ֣ר וְ⁠אוֹיֵ֔ב	1	A man, and adversary, and an enemy	These words mean the same thing. They emphasize Haman’s complete hostility towards the Jews. Alternate translation: “The one who is our bitter enemy” (A “doublet” can involve the use of more than two words. See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	7	6	j5d7		הָמָ֥ן הָ⁠רָ֖ע הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	this evil Haman	“this evil man Haman”

EST	7	6	j5d9	bita-hq	נִבְעַ֔ת מִ⁠לִּ⁠פְנֵ֥י	1	terrified from before the face of	Here **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. The phrase means that Haman was now extremely afraid to be in the presence of King Ahasuerus and Queen Esther. Alternate translation: “This made Haman terrified to be in the presence of the king and the queen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	7	7	bzd4	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ קָ֤ם בַּ⁠חֲמָת⁠וֹ֙ מִ⁠מִּשְׁתֵּ֣ה הַ⁠יַּ֔יִן	1	Then the king rose up in his rage from the banquet of wine	Here “in his rage” is an idiom meaning to be extremely angry. Alternate translation: “The king was extremely angry and got up” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	7	7	j6d1	figs-explicit	קָ֤ם…אֶל־גִּנַּ֖ת הַ⁠בִּיתָ֑ן	1	rose up…to the garden of the palace	The implication is that Ahasuerus went outside to absorb the shock that a man he had promoted to the highest position in his empire was plotting to destroy his queen and her whole people. Ahasuerus needed to sort out his conflicting loyalties and decide what to do about this. You can say explicitly why he went outside. Alternate translation: “He went outside into the palace garden to decide what to do.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	7	7	uaq6	bita-humanbehavior	לְ⁠בַקֵּ֤שׁ עַל־נַפְשׁ⁠וֹ֙	1	in order to seek for his life	Here **seeking** figuratively means to beg or plead urgently for something. This phrase means that Haman wanted to beg Esther to persuade the king not to order his execution. Alternate translation: “to beg Queen Esther to save his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	7	7	qz1m	bita-humanbehavior	כִּ֣י רָאָ֔ה	1	for he saw	Here **seeing** is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “he realized” or “he understood” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	7	7	nin1	figs-activepassive	כָלְתָ֥ה אֵלָ֛י⁠ו הָ⁠רָעָ֖ה מֵ⁠אֵ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	evil was determined against him by the king	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “the king had decided to cause a disaster against him” or “the king was decided to destroy him” or “the king had decided to kill him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	7	7	j6d3	figs-abstractnouns	כָלְתָ֥ה אֵלָ֛י⁠ו הָ⁠רָעָ֖ה מֵ⁠אֵ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	evil was determined against him by the king	Here the abstract noun “evil” means “harm,” not something that is morally wrong as in the previous verse. In this context, it can be expressed with a verb such as “execute.” Alternate translation: “the king was likely to execute him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	7	8	j6d5	figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠מֶּ֡לֶךְ שָׁב֩…וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל	1	Now when the king returned…Haman was fallen	The implication is that when the king returned to the room, he saw what this verse describes next. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “when the king returned …, he saw that Haman had fallen …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you can add that information to the end of this phrase: “…as he was pleading for his life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	7	8	acb8	figs-events	וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	Now…Haman was fallen on the couch on which Esther was	If you prefer to present the events in chronological order, you can put this information first in the verse. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
EST	7	8	acb9		וְ⁠הָמָן֙ נֹפֵ֔ל עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	Now…Haman was fallen on the couch on which Esther was	The expression **was fallen** means that as Haman was begging for his life, he was not standing up, but he had suddenly come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a couch (From the impression that the king got when he returned, it’s possible that Haman was even grabbing her arms or shoulders as he pleaded with her.) Alternate translation: “Haman had come down very close to Esther as she was reclining on a banqueting couch” or “Haman had thrown himself down on the couch where Esther was reclining.”
EST	7	8	acc0		הַ⁠מִּטָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אֶסְתֵּ֣ר עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	the couch on which Esther was	In this culture, especially at a banquet like this one, people would recline on couches as they ate and drank. Alternate translation: “Esther’s banqueting couch”
EST	7	8	thq6	figs-rquestion	הֲ֠⁠גַם לִ⁠כְבּ֧וֹשׁ אֶת־הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֛ה עִמִּ֖⁠י בַּ⁠בָּ֑יִת	1	Is it also to subdue the queen, with me, in the house?	This is a statement, but the king phrases it as a question to show his shock and anger at what he thinks Haman is doing. Alternate translation: “He is even trying to rape the queen!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EST	7	8	l4ce	figs-euphemism	לִ⁠כְבּ֧וֹשׁ אֶת־הַ⁠מַּלְכָּ֛ה	1	to subdue the queen	The story is using a mild expression to refer to something that is disturbing. In this context, “subdue” means “rape.” The king thought that Haman was trying to rape Esther, and he likely said just that. You can show this in your translation. Alternate translation: “trying to rape the queen” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
EST	7	8	acc1	figs-parallelism	עִמִּ֖⁠י בַּ⁠בָּ֑יִת	1	with me, in the house	These two phrases mean similar things. The repetition is used to emphasize the idea that they are expressing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. However, each one does indicate something slightly different about what a serious offense it would be if Haman actually were trying to rape Esther. It would be a violation of the king’s personal trust, and a violation of the trust implicit in hospitality. So you can also include both phrases. Alternate translation: “in my presence and in my own house” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	7	8	adq6	figs-idiom	הַ⁠דָּבָ֗ר יָצָא֙ מִ⁠פִּ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	The word was going out from the mouth of the king	This expression describes the action of speaking. Alternate translation: “As soon as the king said this” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	7	8	acc2	grammar-connect-time-background	הַ⁠דָּבָ֗ר…וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ	1	The word was going out…when they covered the face of Haman	The king spoke, and then the servants covered Haman’s face. One action followed upon another. However, this happened so quickly that almost no time seemed to pass in between. You can indicate this with a phrase like “as soon as.” Alternate translation: “As soon as the king said this, they covered Haman’s face” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
EST	7	8	j6d9	figs-explicit	וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ	1	when they covered the face of Haman	The implication is that some the king’s servants who were present did this, and they did it because they understood that the king wanted Haman to be executed. Alternate translation: “some of his servants covered Haman’s face as a sign that he would be executed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	7	8	acc3	translate-symaction	וּ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָמָ֖ן חָפֽוּ	1	when they covered the face of Haman	Covering the face, in this culture as in many others, was a sign that a person had been condemned to death.

EST	7	9	j7d3		הִנֵּה	1	behold	**Behold** is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, it can be omitted from your translation. But consider using an expression that is natural in your language for someone to address the king directly to get his attention, for example, “O king!”

Specifically, Mordecai reported an assassination plot and saved the king’s life. Alternate translation: “Mordecai, who saved your life.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	7	9	j7d9	figs-123person	דִּבֶּר־ט֣וֹב עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	spoke good for the king	Harbona addresses the king in the third person as a way of showing respect. Alternate translation: “saved your life” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

See how you translated this phrase in 5:14. Alternate translation: “seventy-five feet high” or “twenty-three meters high” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
EST	7	9	acc7	figs-explicit	תְּלֻ֥⁠הוּ עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	Hang him on it	**Him** means Haman. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Impale [or hang] Haman on it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	7	10	j8d3	bita-plants	הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	the tree	As in the previous verse, this refers to a wooden pole or gallows. See how you translated the term there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

EST	7	10	umd4	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠חֲמַ֥ת הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ שָׁכָֽכָה	1	and the rage of the king subsided	Here the story figuratively compares the king’s anger to floodwaters, which can cause great destruction. “Subside” means for waters to drain away and for their level to go down. You could express the meaning by saying something like, “Then the king’s rage lessened,” or “Then the king was not so angry.” Or you could use a different metaphor that would be meaningful in your language, such as, “Then the king cooled off.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

EST	8	1	j8d5	writing-newevent	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠ה֗וּא	1	On that day	This could mean one of three things. (1) A new series of events is now being described, but the story wants to make clear that they happened on the same day as the second banquet. While it must have been some time later in the day, the idea is when Haman lost his life, and his property with it, Esther gained what her enemy had lost. Alternate translation: “That same day” (2) The expression could also be an idiom that means “as of that day.” This would refer to the effective date for the transfer of Haman’s property to Esther. Alternate translation: “As of that day.” (3) The term “day” could also be used figuratively to mean around the same time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

The story could be referring to all the property by naming one part of it, the house. Or “house” could be a metonym for “property,” meaning everything a person owns and keeps in their house, and by extension everything they own beyond the house as well. Alternate translation: “King Ahasuerus declared that everything that Haman had owned would now belong to Queen Esther” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. Alternate translation: “When he learned that, the king summoned Mordecai to come into his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	1	j8d9	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	before the face of the king	Here **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person.

If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly.

EST	8	2	acd1	translate-unknown	טַבַּעְתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	signet ring	See how you translated this in 3:10. Review the explanation there if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “the ring that had his official seal on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	8	2	j9d3	figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱבִיר֙ מֵֽ⁠הָמָ֔ן	1	that he had caused to pass from Haman	This means that the king had taken back his signet ring from Haman. He would have done this when he sentenced Haman to death. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “The king had given Haman the ring that had his official seal on it. But he had taken it back from him when he sentenced him to death, and he was wearing it again.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	2	acd2	figs-events	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֶֽעֱבִיר֙ מֵֽ⁠הָמָ֔ן	1	that he had caused to pass from Haman	You can put this information first in the verse because it happened before everything else. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])

EST	8	2	z5yn		וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠מָרְדֳּכָ֑י	1	and he gave it to Mordecai	By giving his signet ring to Mordecai, the king gave Mordecai the authority to write important papers that people would have to obey.
EST	8	2	d2tj	figs-metonymy	בֵּ֥ית הָמָֽן	1	the house of Haman	See the explanation of this phrase in verse 1. Alternate translation: “everything that Haman had owned” or “the household of Haman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Alternate translation: “Then Esther again spoke in the king’s presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
EST	8	3	j9d7	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	before the face of the king	Here **face** figuratively represents the presence of a person. Alternate translation: “while she was in his presence” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	8	3	j9d9	figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	And she fell before the face of his feet	Here **falling** is an idiom referring to the action of bowing down or prostrating oneself, and **face** figuratively represents the front of a person, place, or object. Alternate translation: “and she bowed down” or “and she prostrated herself” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
EST	8	3	acd4	translate-symaction	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	And she fell before the face of his feet	This may actually mean that Esther put her face right on top of the feet of King Ahasuerus. This would have been an act of humility and desperation by which she showed that her need was very great and that she believed the king had great power to help her. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EST	8	3	acd5	figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּפֹּ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	And she fell before the face of his feet	Esther’s action was probably a recognized sign of pleading in this culture. However, it would likely still have been remarkable for a queen to fall at the feet of her husband, the king. You can show this by introducing the information with a phrase like “in fact.” Alternate translation: “In fact, to show how desperately she was pleading, Esther got down and put her face right on top of his feet.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	3	j1r1	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	before the face of his feet	Here **face** is a metonym meaning the front of a person, place, or object. This phrase means that Esther prostrated herself in front of the feet of King Ahasuerus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

In that earlier episode, this indicated that he would not enforce the law that said Esther should be executed for coming into the inner court without being summoned. But since Esther was apparently already in the king’s presence on this occasion, it seems that the gesture could also be used generally to show that the king was positively disposed towards a person and would grant their request. Alternate translation: “The king held out his golden scepter to Esther.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
EST	8	4	acd7	translate-unknown	שַׁרְבִ֣ט הַ⁠זָּהָ֑ב	1	the scepter of gold	See how you translated this in 4:11. If it would be helpful, review the explanation of what this object was. Alternate translation: “golden scepter” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

EST	8	4	j1r5	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	before the face of the king	Here **face** figuratively represents the front of a person, place, or object. This phrase means the Esther now stood facing King Ahasuerus. Alternate translation: “and stood facing the king” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	8	5	w7yl	figs-parallelism	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	If it is good to the king, and if I have found favor before his face, and the word is proper before the face of the king, and I am good in his eyes	These two pairs of phrases mean basically the same thing. Esther is saying that the king should grant her request if what she is going to suggest seems like a good idea to him, and if he is positively disposed towards her. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize the importance of what she is expressing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “If what I am going to suggest seems like a good idea to you, and if you are pleased with me.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	8	5	acd9	figs-123person	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו	1	If it is good to the king, and if I have found favor before his face, and the word is proper before the face of the king, and I am good in his eyes	Here Esther addresses the king throughout in the third person as a way of showing respect. You could express the same meaning in the second person. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	8	5	ace0	figs-idiom	אִם־עַל־הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ ט֜וֹב	1	If it is good to the king	This is an idiom that also appears in 1:19, 3:9, 5:4, and 5:8. A suggested translation in those cases was, “If it seems like a good idea to you, O king.” That was suitable for the deferential tone the speakers were using. But in another place, 7:3, when Esther was pleading urgently for the survival of her whole people, the suggested alternate translation was, “I hope you will be willing to do what I ask.” Esther is also pleading here, so you could use that phrase here in your translation as well. Alternate translation: “if what I ask for seems right in the king’s evaluation” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	8	5	ftc7	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אִם־מָצָ֧אתִי חֵ֣ן	1	if I have found favor	This expression also appears many times in the story. It means to gain the approval or acceptance of another person. Alternate translation: “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	8	5	j1r7	bita-hq	לְ⁠פָנָ֗י⁠ו…לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	before his face…before the face of the king	Here **face** figuratively means the presence of a person. These phrases could mean, “As I stand here before you.” But “face” could also be referring figuratively to the king himself by naming one part of him. What he thought and felt about Esther’s request would become evident in his face first, so it would be an appropriate part of him to use to represent all of him. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
EST	8	5	xci7	bita-hq	בְּ⁠עֵינָ֑י⁠ו	1	in his eyes	Here **eyes** figuratively represent the action of seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. Alternate translation: “if you evaluate me and I please you” or “if you are pleased with me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	8	5	j1r9	figs-idiom	יִכָּתֵ֞ב לְ⁠הָשִׁ֣יב אֶת־הַ⁠סְּפָרִ֗ים	1	let it be written to take back the letters	The first letters that told of the plan to destroy the Jews would not be brought back to Susa physically. Rather, “bring back” is an idiom that means “cancel” or “revoke.” Alternate translation: “make a new law to cancel what Haman decreed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	8	5	nbk3	figs-activepassive	יִכָּתֵ֞ב לְ⁠הָשִׁ֣יב אֶת־הַ⁠סְּפָרִ֗ים	1	let it be written	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “write a new letter” or “make a new law” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	8	5	j2r1		מַחֲשֶׁ֜בֶת הָמָ֤ן בֶּֽן־הַמְּדָ֨תָא֙ הָ⁠אֲגָגִ֔י	1	the plot of Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite	“that Haman, the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, sent out”
EST	8	5	s7bt		לְ⁠אַבֵּד֙ אֶת־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֖ר בְּ⁠כָל־מְדִינ֥וֹת הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	to destroy the Jews who are in all of the provinces of the king	“His letter said to destroy all the Jews everything in your empire”
EST	8	6	j2r5	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֠י	1	For	Here Esther is giving the reason why she is asking King Ahasuerus to revoke the letters. Alternate translation: “I am asking this because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EST	8	6	udt6	figs-rquestion	אֵיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑⁠י וְ⁠אֵֽיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י	1	how could I bear to see the evil that my people would find? And how could I bear seeing the destruction of my kindred?	Esther is actually making a statement, but she expresses herself in question form to show how strongly she feels about what she is saying. She does not actually expect the king to tell her how she could bear seeing her people destroyed. Alternate translation: “I cannot bear to see disaster fall on the Jews. I cannot endure watching my relatives be killed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
EST	8	6	ace1	figs-parallelism	אֵיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה אֲשֶׁר־יִמְצָ֣א אֶת־עַמִּ֑⁠י וְ⁠אֵֽיכָכָ֤ה אוּכַל֙ וְֽ⁠רָאִ֔יתִי בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י	1	how could I bear to see the evil that my people would find? And how could I bear seeing the destruction of my kindred?	These two sentences mean basically the same thing. Esther uses the repetition to emphasize what she is saying. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases. Alternate translation: “I could not bear to see my relatives and my whole people destroyed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
EST	8	6	ace2	figs-abstractnouns	בָּ⁠רָעָ֖ה	1	the evil	Even though it was morally very wrong for Haman to want to destroy Mordecai’s whole people, here the abstract noun “evil” likely means “harm,” as in 7:7. It means the same thing as “destruction” in the next sentence. In this context, the term can be expressed with a verb such as “destroyed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	8	6	ace3	figs-idiom	יִמְצָ֣א	1	would find	As in 1:5, “found” is an idiom that means something exists in a certain place or time, not that people were looking for it and located it. Esther is speaking of the harm that will exist for the Jews if the effect of Haman’s letters is not undone. Alternate translation: “would be destroyed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	8	6	ace4	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠אָבְדַ֖ן	1	the destruction of	This abstract noun can be expressed with a verb such as “destroyed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
EST	8	6	ace5		מוֹלַדְתִּֽ⁠י	1	my kindred	“relatives”
EST	8	7	j2r7		הִנֵּ֨ה	1	Behold	This is a term meant to focus the attention of the listener on what the speaker is about to say. If there is not a good way to translate this term in your language, this term can be omitted from the translation. Or you can use an alternate translation such as, “As you know.”
EST	8	7	ace6		בֵית־הָמָ֜ן נָתַ֣תִּי לְ⁠אֶסְתֵּ֗ר	1	I have given the house of Haman to Esther	See the note about this expression in 8:1. Alternate translation: “I have given Esther all the property that belonged to Haman” or “I have given Esther the household of Haman”
EST	8	7	h44h	bita-hq	בֵית־הָמָ֜ן	1	the house of Haman	Here **house** is a metonym meaning the entire household of Haman. Alternate translation: “the household of Haman” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
EST	8	7	ace7	figs-events	וְ⁠אֹת⁠וֹ֙ תָּל֣וּ עַל־הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ	1	they have hanged him on the tree	Alternate translation: “I had my servants impale Haman on a wooden pole” or “I had my servants hang Haman on a gallows.” You can put this information first, because it happened before the king gave Haman’s property to Esther. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-events]])
EST	8	7	ace8	bita-plants	הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ	1	the tree	See how you translated this term in 2:23, 5:14, 6:4, 7:9, and 7:10. Review the note to 2:23 if that would be helpful. Alternate translation: “wooden pole” or “gallows” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-plants]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	8	7	ace9		עַ֛ל אֲשֶׁר	1	on account of that	“because”
EST	8	7	j2r9	figs-idiom	שָׁלַ֥ח יָד֖⁠וֹ	1	he stretched out his hand	Here the expression “to stretch out a hand” means to cause someone physical harm with the intention of killing them. Alternate translation: “because he wanted to kill all the Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	8	8	acf0		וְ֠⁠אַתֶּם	1	So you	“So this is what you should do”
EST	8	8	acf1		כִּתְב֨וּ עַל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֜ים כַּ⁠טּ֤וֹב בְּ⁠עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	write for the Jews as is good in your eyes	“I am giving you permission to write other letters, to save your people”
EST	8	8	j3r1	bita-hq	כַּ⁠טּ֤וֹב בְּ⁠עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	as is good in your eyes	Here **eyes** figuratively represent the action of seeing, and seeing is a metaphor for knowledge, notice, attention, or judgment. This phrase means that Esther and Mordecai have permission to write what they think is best. Alternate translation: “as you think is best” or “what you think is best” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	8	8	j3mn	bita-hq	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	in the name of the king	Here **name** is a metaphor meaning authority. This phrase means Esther and Mordecai have permission to write with the authority of the King Ahasuerus. (See: Metaphor) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	8	8	acf2	figs-123person	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	in the name of the king	King Ahasuerus refers to himself in the third person. You can have him say this in the first person. Alternate translation: “I give you permission to write with my own authority” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	8	8	j3r3	translate-unknown	בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	with the signet ring of the king	This is a special ring that could be used to imprint the king’s official seal on a law or decree. Alternate translation: “the ring that has my official seal on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
EST	8	8	acf3	figs-123person	בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	with the signet ring of the king	King Ahasuerus refers to himself in the third person. You can have him say this in the first person. Alternate translation: “the ring that has my official seal on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
EST	8	8	j3r5	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי	1	For	Here King Ahasuerus is expressing the reason why he cannot write a new letter revoking the first one, and so Esther and Mordecai should address the situation as they think best. Alternate translation: “But” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
EST	8	8	acf4		כְתָ֞ב…אֵ֥ין לְ⁠הָשִֽׁיב	1	there is none to take back a writing	As in verse 5, this expression means “revoke.” Alternate translation: “no one can revoke”
EST	8	8	acf5		כְתָ֞ב…אֵ֥ין לְ⁠הָשִֽׁיב	1	there is none to take back a writing	You can put this first in the verse, because it explains why Ahasuerus answers Esther and Mordecai in the way he does.
EST	8	8	acf6	figs-explicit	כְתָ֞ב אֲשֶׁר־נִכְתָּ֣ב בְּ⁠שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ וְ⁠נַחְתּ֛וֹם בְּ⁠טַבַּ֥עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	a writing that has been written in the name of the king and has been sealed with the signet ring of the king	The king is describing a general situation, but he has Haman’s letter specifically in mind. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “Haman wrote his letter with my authority, and he sealed it with the ring that has my official seal on it. No one can revoke a letter like that.” (The story explained in 1:19 that the king’s laws could not be changed once they had been made and proclaimed.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	9	acf7	grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּקָּרְא֣וּ סֹפְרֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ	1	So…were called	This indicates that what is described in this verse was done because of what the king said in the previous verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

EST	8	9	acf8		וַ⁠יִּקָּרְא֣וּ סֹפְרֵֽי־הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ	1	So the scribes of the king were called	If you use an expression such as “called,” make sure your readers will understand that the king likely sent an official to go and bring the scribes back with him. The king did not call out in a loud voice to get them to come.
EST	8	9	j4r1	translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠חֹ֨דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֜י	1	in the third month	“in month three” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EST	8	9	acf9	figs-explicit	בַּ⁠חֹ֨דֶשׁ הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֜י	1	in the third month	Alternate translation: “in the third month of the year.” It would still be the same year as in 3:7, the twelfth year that Ahasuerus reigned as king of Persia. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	9	j356	translate-hebrewmonths	הוּא־חֹ֣דֶשׁ סִיוָ֗ן	1	which is the month of Sivan	“Sivan” is the name of the third month of the Hebrew calendar. Alternate translation: “the month of Sivan” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
EST	8	9	acg1		הוּא־חֹ֣דֶשׁ סִיוָ֗ן	1	which is the month of Sivan	The story is being recorded from the perspective of the Persian court. But for the benefit of its intended Jewish audience, the Hebrew name of the month is given.
EST	8	9	j4r3	translate-ordinal	בִּ⁠שְׁלוֹשָׁ֣ה וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִים֮ בּ⁠וֹ֒	1	on the twenty-third of it	Alternation translation: “on day 23” or “on the twenty-third day of the month.” The exact date of the letter helps establish its legal authority. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
EST	8	9	sz6j	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּכָּתֵ֣ב כְּֽ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁר־צִוָּ֣ה מָרְדֳּכַ֣י	1	And according to all that Mordecai commanded it was written	You can say this with an active form. Alternate translation: “and they wrote a letter saying everything that Mordecai told them to write” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
EST	8	9	acg2	figs-explicit	אֶל־הַ⁠יְּהוּדִ֡ים	1	to the Jews	It appears from verse 11 that the letter would have been addressed specifically to the Jews in the empire, telling them that the king had authorized them to defend themselves. But copies were also sent to all the royal and provincial officials. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say this explicitly. “The letter addressed the Jews in the empire, but copies were also sent” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	9	acg3		וְ⁠אֶ֣ל הָ⁠אֲחַשְׁדַּרְפְּנִֽים־וְ⁠הַ⁠פַּחוֹת֩ וְ⁠שָׂרֵ֨י הַ⁠מְּדִינ֜וֹת	1	and to the satraps, and the governors and officials of the provinces	See how you translated these terms in 3:12, where they were used to describe who received Haman’s letter. Alternate translation: “to the royal officials, and to the governors and leaders in each province”

See how you translated this phrase in 1:1. Alternate translation: “The empire of Ahasuerus had 127 provinces, stretching all the way from India in the east to Ethiopia in the west.”
EST	8	9	zp4q	translate-numbers	שֶׁ֣בַע וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֤ים וּ⁠מֵאָה֙ מְדִינָ֔ה	1	127 provinces	Alternate translation: “one hundred and twenty-seven provinces” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

Alternate translation: “They wrote especially to the Jews, in their own script and in their own language.”
EST	8	10	acg5		וַ⁠יִּכְתֹּ֗ב…וַ⁠יַּחְתֹּ֖ם	1	And he wrote…and he sealed	**He** means Mordecai. You can use his name here in your translation.
EST	8	10	ijp2	bita-hq	בְּ⁠שֵׁם֙ הַ⁠מֶּ֣לֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרֹ֔שׁ	1	in the name of King Ahasuerus	Here **name** is a metaphor meaning authority. Alternate translation: “Mordecai wrote with the authority of King Ahasuerus” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	8	10	jf31	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּחְתֹּ֖ם בְּ⁠טַבַּ֣עַת הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	and he sealed with the signet ring of the king	This means that Mordecai sealed the letters with this ring. If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. Alternate translation: “and he sealed the letters with the ring that had the king’s official seal on it” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	10	yt4j	bita-hq	בְּ⁠יַד֩ הָ⁠רָצִ֨ים בַּ⁠סּוּסִ֜ים	1	by the hand of runners on horses	As in 3:13, **hand** could mean two different things. 1) It could literally mean “hand,” meaning that the runners carried the letters in their hands. 2) It could also be a metaphor for power, control, or authority, meaning that runners were the ones who delivered the letters to all the provinces throughout the empire. Alternate translation: “Couriers on horseback delivered the letters” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	8	10	acg6		רֹכְבֵ֤י הָ⁠רֶ֨כֶשׁ֙ הָֽ⁠אֲחַשְׁתְּרָנִ֔ים בְּנֵ֖י הָֽ⁠רַמָּכִֽים	1	riders of the royal pack horses, sons of the mares	“They rose fast horses that were used in the king’s service. These horses had been bred in the king’s stables.”

EST	8	11	j5r5	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠כָל־עִיר־וָ⁠עִ֗יר	1	in every city by city	This expression means “in each and every city.” It is possibly referring to the entire empire by naming one part of it, its cities. The story says in 9:19 that Jews living in rural areas also defended themselves, not just Jews living in cities. It is likely that the messengers only published the news in the cities and not the entire countryside, but the news was certainly intended for everyone, not only people living in the cities. Alternate translation: “throughout the empire” or “in each and every city” or “in every single city” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
EST	8	11	e1mj	bita-humanbehavior	לְ⁠הִקָּהֵל֮ וְ⁠לַ⁠עֲמֹ֣ד עַל־נַפְשָׁ⁠ם֒	1	to gather and to stand for their life	Here **standing** is a metaphor meaning to defend oneself and fight back instead of running away from an enemy. Alternate translation: “to join together and fight for their lives” or “fight back” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
EST	8	11	j5r7	figs-doublet	לְ⁠הַשְׁמִיד֩ וְ⁠לַ⁠הֲרֹ֨ג וּ⁠לְ⁠אַבֵּ֜ד	1	to annihilate, and to slaughter, and to destroy	These words mean the same thing and are used together to emphasize the completeness of the destruction that is being described. See how you translated this in 3:13 and 7:4. Alternate translation: “completely destroy” (A “doublet” can involve the use of more than two words. See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
EST	8	11	acg7	figs-metonymy	כָּל־חֵ֨יל עַ֧ם וּ⁠מְדִינָ֛ה הַ⁠צָּרִ֥ים אֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	any strength of a people or province that would attack them	**Strength** is a figurative way of referring to an army or to a person carrying weaponry.

EST	8	12	ach2	figs-explicit	לְ⁠חֹ֥דֶשׁ שְׁנֵים־עָשָׂ֖ר	1	of the twelfth month	Implicitly this means “the twelfth month of that same year.” If it would be clearer in your language, you can say that explicitly. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	8	12	j6r4	translate-hebrewmonths	הוּא־חֹ֥דֶשׁ אֲדָֽר	1	which is the month of Adar	This is the name of the twelfth and last month of the Hebrew calendar. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-hebrewmonths]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

EST	8	13	qk1d	figs-idiom	לְ⁠הִנָּקֵ֖ם מֵ⁠אֹיְבֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	to take revenge from their enemies	This expression “to take revenge from” another person means to correct a wrong they have done. In this context, the phrase means to correct the wrong of the original law that gave people permission to kill the Jews. Alternate translation: “and fight back against their enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

You can add a word such as “readily” to indicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	9	23	aco8		וְ⁠קִבֵּל֙	1	And…accepted	“agreed”

Alternate translation: “he threw Pur (that is, he threw lots) to find out what would be the best day to attack the Jews” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
EST	9	24	bcy2	translate-names	פּוּר֙ ה֣וּא הַ⁠גּוֹרָ֔ל	1	a Pur (which is "the lot")	As in 3:7, the storyteller is giving both the Persian and the Hebrew name because this is the story behind the Festival of Purim, which takes its name from “Pur.” So this is not repetition for emphasis. You can put in the Persian name and the name for “lot” in your own language to show that the storyteller is doing this. Alternate translation: “a Pur (that is, a lot)” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

EST	9	25	j128	bita-hq	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הַ⁠מֶּלֶךְ֒	1	before the face of the king	Here **face** is a metonym meaning the presence of a person. This phrase means that Esther came into the king’s presence.

The story is summarizing the events in compressed form. It is speaking of the letter as if it were something that could take action and give commands like this. Alternate translation: “The king also ordered his servants to impale Haman on a wooden pole [or hang Haman on a gallows]. When the Jews in Susa killed his ten sons, the king had their bodies impaled [or hanged] as well.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

EST	9	26	buf1	writing-background	עַל־שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠פּ֔וּר	1	on account of the name of Pur	Alternate translation: “The Persian word for ‘lot’ is ‘Pur.’” This is information that the original audience needed to understand how this celebration got its name.

It will be explaining why the Jews added this holiday to their calendar, in addition to the festivals that were commanded in the Law of Moses. The next verse describes them adding the holiday.

EST	9	26	acp6	figs-explicit	וּ⁠מָֽה־רָא֣וּ עַל־כָּ֔כָה וּ⁠מָ֥ה הִגִּ֖יעַ אֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	and what they had seen concerning this and what had come upon them	These phrases say generally “this” and “what,” but they are referring to the specific events the story has related.

The repetition is used to emphasize that the Jews definitely agreed to do this. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these words.

The repetition is used to emphasize that the Jews have been faithful in doing this. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the general meaning by saying something like, “The Jews have celebrated these days.” Alternate translation: “They said that they would remember and celebrate on those two days.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])

Generally speaking, a province would be the largest division of the empire that would identify a person’s location, and a city would be the smallest. Particularly since the Jews continued to celebrate Purim after they were living in the Persian empire with its division into provinces, you might choose to express the meaning of this figure of speech.

Ever since the destruction of Jerusalem, the Jews had been fasting and mourning in the fifth month of the year to show their sorrow over what had happened. (The story refers to Babylonian conquest of Jerusalem in 2:6.) You can explain this in more detail.

It does that by showing that he was second in command to a very powerful emperor. The phrase “the islands of the sea” likely refers to the fact that the Persian kings had conquered territories reaching all the way to the Mediterranean Sea.
