OBA	front	intro	jrz8			0		# Introduction to Obadiah<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Obadiah<br><br>1. Yahweh will judge Edom (1:1-16)<br>- Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:1–9)<br>- Why Yahweh will destroy Edom (1:10–14)<br>1. Yahweh will judge the nations (1:15–16)<br>1. Yahweh will deliver his people (1:17–21)<br><br>### What is the Book of Obadiah about?<br><br>After Babylon destroyed Jerusalem, the Edomites captured fleeing Jews. Then they gave these Jews over to Babylon. The Book of Obadiah is about Yahweh judging the Edomites for harming his people. This book would be comforting to the exiled people of Judah.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book is traditionally titled “The Book of Obadiah” or just “Obadiah.” Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as “The Sayings of Obadiah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Obadiah?<br><br>The prophet Obadiah probably wrote this book. We know nothing more about Obadiah. His name in Hebrew means “Servant of Yahweh.”<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was Edom’s relationship to Israel?<br><br>Obadiah referred to Edom as Israel’s brother. This is because the Edomites descended from Esau, and the Israelites descended from Jacob. Jacob and Esau were brothers. This made Edom betraying Israel much worse.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How do I translate the concept of “pride”?<br><br>The Book of Obadiah speaks of the pride of Edom. This meant that the Edomites thought their enemies or Yahweh could not defeat them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/proud]])
OBA	1	1	xm1w	bita-hq	חֲז֖וֹן עֹֽבַדְיָ֑ה	1	The vision of Obadiah	This is the title of the book. Here “vision” is used in the general sense of a message from Yahweh, rather than to indicate how Obadiah received that message. “Vision” here is a metaphor for a way of getting knowledge from God.

OBA	1	1	jdr5	figs-pronouns	שְׁמוּעָ֨ה שָׁמַ֜עְנוּ	1	We have heard a report	You could translate this “I have heard” to show that Obadiah is speaking as one person among the many in the nations around Edom who have heard Yahweh’s message. Another alternative: “Yahweh our God has told me this.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
OBA	1	1	jdr7	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠צִיר֙…שֻׁלָּ֔ח	1	and a messenger has been sent off	You can use the active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “I, Yahweh, have sent a messenger.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

OBA	1	1	jdr9	figs-quotations	ק֛וּמוּ וְ⁠נָק֥וּמָה עָלֶי⁠הָ	1	Get up! And let us rise up against her for battle!	The end of the verse is not spoken by Obadiah himself. Rather, those are the words of Yahweh’s messenger. They can be presented as a quotation with an introductory formula such as “saying,” or as indirect quotation as in UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
OBA	1	1	pez6	figs-idiom	ק֛וּמוּ	1	Get up	This phrase is used to tell people to get ready, in this case to attack Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

They are being described again by reference to something closely associated with them, their land. Alternate translation: “against the people of Edom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	1	jd1r	figs-abstractnouns	לַ⁠מִּלְחָמָֽה	1	for battle	You could translate the abstract noun “battle” with a verb. Alternate translation: “to attack her.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	2	cc3h		הִנֵּ֥ה קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	Behold, I am making you small	The addressee changes here. This is no longer the messenger speaking to the other nations. Yahweh is now speaking directly to Edom. You could add a phrase to indicate this, for example, “Yahweh says this to the people of Edom.”
OBA	1	2	npn6		הִנֵּ֥ה	1	Behold	This alerts the people of Edom to pay special attention to what follows. Alternate translation: “Look” or “Pay attention to what I am about to tell you.”

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	2	ec8m	figs-metaphor	קָטֹ֛ן נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ בַּ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם	1	small among the nations	Something insignificant is spoken of figuratively as if it were small in size and could easily be overlooked. Alternate translation: “insignificant among the nations” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	2	ch1u	figs-activepassive	בָּז֥וּי אַתָּ֖ה מְאֹֽד	1	you are extremely despised	You could state this in the active form. Alternate translation: “the people of other nations will hate you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	3	qpw7	bita-hq	לִבְּ⁠ךָ֙	1	of your heart	Here the heart is used figuratively to refer to a person’s thoughts and feelings. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
OBA	1	3	q6sz		בְ⁠חַגְוֵי־סֶּ֖לַע	1	in the clefts of the rock	This means a place that is protected because it is surrounded by rocks.
OBA	1	3	k9sw	figs-123person	מְר֣וֹם שִׁבְתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	lofty in his dwelling	This says “his” as if Yahweh were talking aloud about Edom rather than to Edom, but it can be translated with “you” as part of Yahweh’s continuing words to the people. Alternate translation: “you who live in the clefts of the rock” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
OBA	1	3	r5zj	figs-123person	אֹמֵ֣ר בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	he who says in his heart	This says “he” and “his,” as if Yahweh were talking aloud about Edom rather than to Edom, but it can be translated with “you” as part of Yahweh’s continuing words to the people.

OBA	1	3	jd3r	bita-hq	בְּ⁠לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	in his heart	Here the heart is used figuratively to refer to a person’s thoughts and feelings. Alternate translation: “say to yourselves” or “think” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
OBA	1	3	i2hx	figs-rquestion	מִ֥י יוֹרִדֵ֖⁠נִי אָֽרֶץ	1	Who will bring me down to the ground?	The question form shows how proud the Edomites were and how safe they felt. Alternate translation: “No one can bring me down to the ground” or “I am safe from all attackers.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	4	xn9f	figs-parallelism	אִם־תַּגְבִּ֣יהַּ כַּ⁠נֶּ֔שֶׁר וְ⁠אִם־בֵּ֥ין כּֽוֹכָבִ֖ים שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	If you make yourself high like the eagle, even if your nest is set between the stars	The two expressions have similar meanings. Yahweh is showing that what he is saying is important by saying it more than once in slightly different ways. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	4	jd5r	figs-hyperbole	אִם־תַּגְבִּ֣יהַּ כַּ⁠נֶּ֔שֶׁר וְ⁠אִם־בֵּ֥ין כּֽוֹכָבִ֖ים שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	If you make yourself high like the eagle, even if your nest is set between the stars	The people of Edom think they are safe because they live up high in the mountains. Yahweh is saying that even if they lived much higher than it is actually possible for humans to live, they would still not be safe. Alternate translation: “And I tell you that even if you had wings and could fly higher than eagles fly, and if you could make your homes among the stars” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
OBA	1	4	jd7r	figs-activepassive	שִׂ֣ים קִנֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	if your nest is set	You could use the active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “if you could make your homes.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	4	bbu3	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠שָּׁ֥ם אוֹרִֽידְ⁠ךָ֖	1	from there I will bring you down	Yahweh’s response to the Edomites is that they would not be safe anywhere from his judgment and punishment. Alternate translation: “you would still not be safe there from the attackers that I am sending.” This is a spatial metaphor. “Bringing down” means humbling. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	5	w86v	figs-doublet	אִם־גַּנָּבִ֤ים בָּאֽוּ־לְ⁠ךָ֙ אִם־שׁ֣וֹדְדֵי לַ֔יְלָה	1	If thieves came to you, and plunderers by night	These two phrases mean the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize the idea they are expressing. You could combine them. Alternate translation: “When thieves break into someone’s house during the night and rob them.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
OBA	1	5	b93f	figs-activepassive	אֵ֣יךְ נִדְמֵ֔יתָה	1	how you are being destroyed!	You could use the active form of the verb, and you could specify that the attackers the messenger has summoned will ruin Edom. Alternate translation: “But attackers will completely destroy your country!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	5	jd9r	figs-exclamations	אֵ֣יךְ נִדְמֵ֔יתָה	1	how you are being destroyed!	Yahweh adds this phrase in the middle of another sentence to express that the punishment of Edom is shocking. You could move the phrase to the end of the verse and make it its own sentence. Alternate translation: “But attackers will completely destroy your country!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
OBA	1	5	q1pg	figs-rquestion	אִם־גַּנָּבִ֤ים בָּאֽוּ־לְ⁠ךָ֙ אִם־שׁ֣וֹדְדֵי לַ֔יְלָה	1	would not they steal enough for them?	This is a rhetorical question. The question form is used for emphasis.

OBA	1	5	w64v	figs-explicit	הֲ⁠ל֥וֹא יִגְנְב֖וּ דַּיָּ֑⁠ם	1	would not they steal enough for them?	Yahweh is implying that he will despoil Edom worse than thieves do when they plunder a house. You could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “they would only steal what they wanted, but I will take everything from you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	5	jd11	figs-rquestion	אִם־בֹּֽצְרִים֙ בָּ֣אוּ לָ֔⁠ךְ הֲ⁠ל֖וֹא יַשְׁאִ֥ירוּ עֹלֵלֽוֹת	1	If grape-cutters came to you, would not they leave behind gleanings?	This is a rhetorical question.

OBA	1	5	k12c	figs-rquestion	אִם־בֹּֽצְרִים֙ בָּ֣אוּ לָ֔⁠ךְ הֲ⁠ל֖וֹא יַשְׁאִ֥ירוּ עֹלֵלֽוֹת	1	If grape-cutters came to you, would not they leave behind gleanings?	Yahweh is implying that he will strip away Edom’s possessions more completely than grape harvesters strip vines. You could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: “they would leave some grapes, but I will take everything from you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	6	zsf7	figs-activepassive	אֵ֚יךְ נֶחְפְּשׂ֣וּ עֵשָׂ֔ו נִבְע֖וּ מַצְפֻּנָֽי⁠ו	1	How Esau is being ransacked, his hidden treasures being searched out	You could use the active form for both of these passive verbs. Alternate translation: “these attackers will take away everything that is valuable. They will even find and take away the valuable things that you have hidden.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	6	jd13	figs-explicit	אֵ֚יךְ נֶחְפְּשׂ֣וּ עֵשָׂ֔ו נִבְע֖וּ מַצְפֻּנָֽי⁠ו	1	How Esau is being ransacked, his hidden treasures being searched out	You could state explicitly who will take away Edom’s valuables. Alternate translation: “These attackers will take away everything that is valuable. They will even find and take away the valuable things that you have hidden.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	6	m9p3	figs-personification	עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	Esau	Here the name “Esau” refers to the people of Edom. They were the descendants of Esau, who was also known as Edom. All the people of Edom are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	6	lf9t		נֶחְפְּשׂ֣וּ	1	has been ransacked	This means the enemies have search through Esau’s things, taken everything valuable, and left everything else in a mess or damaged.
OBA	1	7	cr88		עַֽד־הַ⁠גְּב֣וּל שִׁלְּח֗וּ⁠ךָ	1	are sending you away as far as the border	Alternate translation, “They will force you to leave your country.” However, since it is not specified whose border this is, another interpretation would be that the people of Edom will try to take refuge in the lands of their allies, but they won’t be allowed to.
OBA	1	7	a612	figs-parallelism	כֹּ֚ל אַנְשֵׁ֣י בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ…אַנְשֵׁ֣י שְׁלֹמֶ֑⁠ךָ לַחְמְ⁠ךָ֗	1	All the men of your covenant…The men of your peace…They of your bread	All three phrases refer to Edom’s allies. Yahweh is showing that what he is saying is important by saying it more than once in similar ways. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	7	n3t6		בְרִיתֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	your covenant	The word “your” refers to the nation of Edom.
OBA	1	7	jd15	figs-ellipsis	לַחְמְ⁠ךָ֗ יָשִׂ֤ימוּ מָזוֹר֙ תַּחְתֶּ֔י⁠ךָ	1	They of your bread will set a trap under you	Hebrew says simply “your bread.” Hearers and readers are expected to understand the meaning and supply the missing words in their minds. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
OBA	1	7	rc1i	figs-explicit	אֵ֥ין תְּבוּנָ֖ה בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	There is no understanding in him.	Yahweh could be saying this as an aside about the people of Edom, rather than speaking to them. (See: Aside) Alternately, the former allies could be saying this about Edom. Alternate translation: “Then they will say to you, ‘You are not as clever as you thought you were!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	7	jd17	figs-abstractnouns	תְּבוּנָ֖ה	1	understanding	You could translate the abstract noun “understanding” with a verb. Alternate translation: “They will say to you, ‘You are not as clever as you thought you were!’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	7	jd19	figs-personification	בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	in him	That is, Edom. All the people are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	8	i4rg	figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֛וֹא בַּ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא נְאֻם־יְהוָ֑ה וְ⁠הַאֲבַדְתִּ֤י חֲכָמִים֙ מֵֽ⁠אֱד֔וֹם וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו	1	Will I not on that day (a declaration of Yahweh) destroy wise men from Edom, and understanding from the mountain of Esau?	This is a rhetorical question. Yahweh uses the question form to emphasize that Edom’s destruction is certain. Alternate translation: “‘On that day,’ says Yahweh, ‘I will certainly destroy …’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
OBA	1	8	jd21	figs-explicit	חֲכָמִים֙	1	wise men	The original audience would have known that Edom was famous for its wisdom. However, when Edom is destroyed, it will become clear that its people were not wise to think they were safe because they lived on rugged cliffs. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	8	jd23	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠תְבוּנָ֖ה	1	and understanding	You could translate this abstract noun with a verb, for example, “No one will know what to do any more.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	8	z8tf	figs-synecdoche	מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָֽׂו	1	from the mountain of Esau	Most of the land of Esau was mountains, so this is one way of referring to the land of Edom. This was one of the mountains in Edom. It is sometimes identified with Mount Bozrah. Yahweh is referring to the whole territory by the name of one prominent part of it. Alternate translation: “the land of Edom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	9	jd25	figs-apostrophe	וְ⁠חַתּ֥וּ גִבּוֹרֶ֖י⁠ךָ תֵּימָ֑ן	1	And your mighty men will be dismayed, O Teman	Yahweh stops speaking to the people of Edom and addresses a region of the country, even though it cannot understand him. This shows that Yahweh feels very strongly about what he is saying. (See Apostrophe) Alternate translation: “The soldiers in the army of Edom will become terrified.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe]])
OBA	1	9	qvg3	translate-names	תֵּימָ֑ן	1	Teman	Teman is the name of a region in the land of Edom. Yahweh is referring to the whole territory of Edom by the name of one part of it. (See Synecdoche) Alternate translation: “The soldiers in the army of Edom.”
OBA	1	9	ljv4	grammar-connect-logic-goal	לְמַ֧עַן	1	so that	There is a cause-and-effect relationship here. The soldiers in the army of Edom will become “dismayed,” that is, they will give up and stop fighting. This will leave everyone else defenseless, and so they will all be destroyed. Alternate translation: “when your army stops fighting.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
OBA	1	9	jd27	figs-metaphor	יִכָּֽרֶת־אִ֛ישׁ	1	a man will be cut off	“Cut off” here is a metaphor for being killed. The Edomites aren’t actually part of the mountain, but they live there, so it’s as if something is being cut off or taken away from the mountain. Alternate translation: “your enemies will completely destroy all you people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	9	q6s7	figs-activepassive	יִכָּֽרֶת	1	will be cut off	You could use an active verb form, and you could specify who will do the action. Alternate translation: “your enemies will … destroy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	9	jd31	figs-gendernotations	אִ֛ישׁ	1	a man	Hebrew “man” means “every person” here. Alternate translation: “all you people.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
OBA	1	9	jd33		אִ֛ישׁ	1	a man	Yahweh says in v. 8 that he will destroy the wise men in Edom, and here in v. 9 that the mighty men will be “dismayed” (that is, they will give up trying to fight). The implication is that no one else will escape the invading armies either. Yahweh is basically challenging everyone in Edom by asking, “If the ones you would count on most to rescue you, the wise and the strong, will be destroyed by these attackers, how can anyone else think they will survive?” You can use similar words in verse 8 and 9 to show how this argument develops over these two verses.
OBA	1	9	jd35	figs-synecdoche	מֵ⁠הַ֥ר עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	from the mountain of Esau	As in v. 8, Yahweh is referring to the whole territory by the name of this one part of it. Alternate translation: “who live the land of Edom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	9	jd37	figs-abstractnouns	מִ⁠קָּֽטֶל	1	by slaughter	The abstract noun “slaughter” intensifies the idea of being “cut off” or killed. You could use an adverb to translate it. Alternate translation: “completely” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	10	jd39	bita-hq	אָחִ֥י⁠ךָ	1	your brother	The term “brother” is being used here to refer to members of a related people group. Alternate translation: “your relatives who are the descendants of Jacob” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])
OBA	1	10	ui6g	figs-personification	יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	Jacob	Here the name “Jacob” refers to the people of Judah, who were his descendants. All the people are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	10	jd41	figs-abstractnouns	תְּכַסְּ⁠ךָ֣ בוּשָׁ֑ה	1	shame will cover you	You could use a verb to translate the abstract noun “shame,” and “you” could do the action instead of receiving it. Alternate translation: “you will feel ashamed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	10	f8g6	figs-idiom	תְּכַסְּ⁠ךָ֣ בוּשָׁ֑ה	1	shame will cover you	To be “covered” with something is an idiom for fully experiencing it. Alternate translation: “you will be completely ashamed” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	10	a113	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נִכְרַ֖תָּ לְ⁠עוֹלָֽם	1	you will be cut off to eternity	You could use an active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “your enemies will destroy you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	10	jd43	figs-explicit	וְ⁠נִכְרַ֖תָּ	1	you will be cut off	You can specify who will do the action. Alternate translation: “your enemies will destroy you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	10	jd45	figs-idiom	וְ⁠נִכְרַ֖תָּ	1	you will be cut off	As in v. 5, this is an idiom for being destroyed. Alternate translation: “destroyed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	11	w6hj	figs-metaphor	עֲמָֽדְ⁠ךָ֣ מִ⁠נֶּ֔גֶד	1	stood opposite	This is a metaphor that gives the picture of a person just standing around and not helping. It figuratively means “did not help him.” You could say that as an Alternate Translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	11	s38y	figs-parallelism	שְׁב֥וֹת זָרִ֖ים חֵיל֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠נָכְרִ֞ים בָּ֣אוּ שְׁעָרָ֗יו	1	strangers took captive his wealth, and foreigners entered his gates	These two phrases mean similar things. They are used together to emphasize that Judah was in a desperate situation. Invading armies were plundering it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	11	rtj8	figs-personification	חֵיל֑⁠וֹ…שְׁעָרָ֗יו	1	his wealth...his gates	“His” refers to “your brother Jacob” (v. 10), meaning the people of Judah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	11	jd46		חֵיל֑⁠וֹ	1	his wealth	In this context, this Hebrew term could either mean “wealth” or “army.”
OBA	1	11	jd47	figs-synecdoche	שְׁעָרָ֗יו	1	his gates	“Gates” means “city.” The gates, the first part of a city that you would come to, are being used to represent the whole city. Alternate translation: “all the cities of Judah” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	11	i8sr	figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַל־יְרוּשָׁלִַ֨ם֙ יַדּ֣וּ גוֹרָ֔ל	1	and cast lots for Jerusalem	This is a figurative way of saying that when all the cities of Judah were conquered, Jerusalem was the big prize. If something is so special that everybody wants to have it and you can't divide it up, you cast lots for it. Alternate translation: “they even plundered Jerusalem.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	11	s4y1	figs-explicit	גַּם־אַתָּ֖ה כְּ⁠אַחַ֥ד מֵ⁠הֶֽם	1	you also were like one of them	Alternate translation: “you were just as bad as those foreigners, because you did nothing to help.” The people of Edom did not do exactly the same things as the “strangers” and “foreigners.” You could use the alternate translation to explain how the people of Edom were still “like” them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	12	jd51		וְ⁠אַל	1	But [you should] not	This phrase is used eight times in verses 12–14. It introduces a statement about how people should generally behave. But in these verses, the statements apply specifically to what the people of Edom have just done to the people of Judah. So an alternate translation in every case would be, “You should not have.” (For example, you could change “you should not rejoice” to “you should not have rejoiced.”)
OBA	1	12	crs1		וְ⁠אַל	1	But [you should] not	Yahweh uses a repetitive series of sentences to show how badly the people of Edom have treated the people of Judah. A repetitive series is called a “litany.” This is a list of the charges against the people of Edom. Yahweh goes on to say in verses 15 and 16 that he has found them guilty of all these charges and will punish them. (See: Litany)
OBA	1	12	e7cd	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אַל־תֵּ֤רֶא	1	But you should not have looked	The Hebrew expression “see” is an idiom here for “enjoy looking at.” Alternate translation: “you should not have gloated over.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	12	crs3		בְ⁠יוֹם	1	on the day of	This expression refers to a specific time when God punishes people for their sin.
OBA	1	12	q8md	figs-personification	אָחִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	your brother	As in v. 10, Yahweh describes the people of Judah as a “brother” to the descendants of Esau because Jacob was the brother of Esau (Edom). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	12	b6h1	figs-personification	בְּ⁠י֣וֹם נָכְר֔⁠וֹ	1	on the day of his misfortune	As in v. 10, Yahweh describes the people of Judah as a “brother” to the descendants of Esau because Jacob was the brother of Esau (Edom). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	12	f7lt	figs-gendernotations	לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יְהוּדָ֖ה	1	over the sons of Judah	Here the word “sons” does not refer only to men. It means all the descendants of Jacob’s son Judah, and more broadly all the Israelites from a number of different tribes who had come to live in the kingdom of Judah at this time. Alternate translation: “the Israelites.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])
OBA	1	12	lxg7	figs-idiom	וְ⁠אַל־תַּגְדֵּ֥ל פִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	And you should not have made your mouth great	This is an idiom for bragging. Alternate translation: “you should not have boasted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	13	wg54	figs-123person	אֵידָ֔⁠ם…אֵיד֑⁠וֹ…אֵידֽ⁠וֹ	1	their calamity…his calamity…his calamity	The Hebrew text says “their” in the first case, meaning the Judeans, and “his” in the second and third cases, meaning “your brother Judah.” But since that is a personification of the Judeans (see v. 10), you can say “their” in every case. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
OBA	1	13	crs5	figs-idiom	אַל־תֵּ֧רֶא	1	you should not have looked	The Hebrew expression “see” is an idiom here for “enjoy looking at.” Alternate translation: “you should not have gloated over” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
OBA	1	13	f9q3	figs-exclamations	גַם־אַתָּ֛ה	1	Yes, you!	Yahweh accuses the people of Edom emphatically, likely in anger, and perhaps also to warn them not to claim to be innocent. You could make this a separate short sentence ending in an exclamation mark. Alternate translation: “Yes, you!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations]])
OBA	1	13	jz38	figs-you	וְ⁠אַל־תִּשְׁלַ֥חְנָה בְ⁠חֵיל֖⁠וֹ	1	And you women should not have looted their wealth	Here the Hebrew has only the word “you,” but it is feminine and plural. So you should add something to show that it means “you women,” unless your language already marks the word “you” for gender and number. Alternate translation: “You women should not have taken away their valuable possessions.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
OBA	1	14	ixs7	translate-unknown	הַ⁠פֶּ֔רֶק	1	crossroads	This means a place where two roads come together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
OBA	1	14	p7i1	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠הַכְרִ֖ית אֶת־פְּלִיטָ֑י⁠ו	1	to cut down his fugitives	This is a metaphor that means “killed.” It is likely a comparison to the way grain is cut down at harvest time. Alternate translation: “killed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	14	qdx9	figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַל־תַּסְגֵּ֥ר שְׂרִידָ֖י⁠ו	1	And you should not have delivered up his survivors	You can make explicit who the Edomites delivered the Judean survivors to. Alternate translation: “You should not have captured the survivors and turned them over to their enemies” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	15	fa9m		כִּֽי־קָר֥וֹב יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה עַל־כָּל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשִׂ֨יתָ֙ יֵעָ֣שֶׂה לָּ֔⁠ךְ גְּמֻלְ⁠ךָ֖ יָשׁ֥וּב בְּ⁠רֹאשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	For the day of Yahweh is near for all the nations. According to what you have done, it will be done to you; your recompense will return on your own head.	Bible experts are not certain whether verse 15 goes with verse 14 as the end of the previous section, or goes with verse 16 as the beginning of the new section.
OBA	1	15	e5t7	grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּֽי־קָר֥וֹב יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה עַל־כָּל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֑ם	1	For the day of Yahweh is near upon all the nations	Yahweh is giving the people of Edom the reason why they should have helped the Israelites instead of joining in attacking them. It’s because Yahweh will soon judge all nations for the way they have treated others. You can make this explicit: “You should have helped others, because” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	15	crs7	figs-idiom	יוֹם־יְהוָ֖ה	1	the day of Yahweh	This expression refers to a specific time when God punishes people for their sin. You can say explicitly that this is what Yahweh will do on that “day.” Alternate translation: “The time … when I, Yahweh, will judge and punish all the nations.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	15	crs9		קָר֥וֹב…עַל	1	near upon	In this context, the expression means “near in time.” Alternate translation: “coming soon.”
OBA	1	15	rd8g	figs-explicit	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר עָשִׂ֨יתָ֙ יֵעָ֣שֶׂה לָּ֔⁠ךְ	1	According to what you have done, it will be done to you	You can specify who will do the action. “I” means “I, Yahweh” as in the previous sentence. You can also specify the reference of “you.” Alternate translation: “I will do the same things to you people of Edom that you did to others” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	15	cr1s	figs-activepassive	יֵעָ֣שֶׂה לָּ֔⁠ךְ	1	it will be done to you	You can use the active form of the verb. Alternate translation: “I will do the same things to you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
OBA	1	15	djk9	figs-metaphor	גְּמֻלְ⁠ךָ֖ יָשׁ֥וּב	1	your recompense will return	This is a metaphor that means “the same things will happen to you.” You could use that as an alternate translation. It’s as if the Edomites have sent bad things out to others, but those things are now going to come back and hurt them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	15	cr3s	figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠רֹאשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	on your own head	The “head” is being used to represent the whole person. Alternate translation: “you” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	16	nf6s	figs-explicit	כִּ֗י כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	For according to how you drank	As in verse 15, Yahweh is giving the people of Edom the reason why they should have helped the Israelites instead of joining in attacking them. It’s because Yahweh will soon judge all nations for the way they have treated others. You can make this explicit: “You should have helped others, because.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	16	cr5s	figs-pastforfuture	כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙ עַל־הַ֣ר קָדְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	according to how you have drunk on my holy mountain	1. One possibility is that Yahweh is saying he has brought the people of Edom into court at Jerusalem, which is the place where he reigns, and found them guilty and punished them there. As noted earlier, Yahweh may be using the past tense to refer to something that will happen in the future. So an alternate translation would be, “I am going to punish you in the holy place where I reign.” 2. Another possibility is that this is referring to how the people of Judah suffered punishment when Jerusalem was destroyed. Alternate translation: “I punished you when Jerusalem was destroyed.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
OBA	1	16	fu2y	figs-pastforfuture	כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	according to how you have drunk	1. Here Yahweh may be using the past tense to refer to something that will happen in the future. In that case, this would be a reference to what Yahweh says in the previous verse, that the time is coming soon when he will judge and punish all the nations. Alternate translation: “I am going to punish you.” 2. Another possibility is that Yahweh is saying that Edom literally did drink to celebrate the defeat of the people of Judah, but they and the other nations will figuratively “drink” (be punished) in the future. No alternate translation would be needed for this second possible interpretation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture]])
OBA	1	16	cr7s	bita-humanbehavior	כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	according to how you have drunk	Drinking (often in the Old Testament “drinking a cup”) can be a metaphor for being punished. (See Biblical Imagery – Human Behavior) Alternate translation: “I will punish you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]])
OBA	1	16	cr9s	figs-you	כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	according to how you have drunk	“You” is plural. 1. It may mean “you people of Edom.” If so, this would be a continuation of what Yahweh tells them in v. 15, that he will do the same things to them that they did to others. Alternate translation: “I will punish you people of Edom.” 2. The plural could also be referring to all the other nations. Alternate translation: “I will punish you other nations.” 3. This could also be referring to the people of Judah, who figuratively “drank the cup of punishment” when Jerusalem was destroyed. Alternate translation: “I punished you people of Judah.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])
OBA	1	16	cr11	figs-explicit	כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר שְׁתִיתֶם֙	1	according to how you have drunk	You can show that the people of Edom are not doing this by themselves by specifying that Yahweh is doing it to them. Alternate translation: “I will … punish you.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	16	ujj9	figs-metonymy	הַ֣ר קָדְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	the mountain of my holiness	This means “on Mount Zion” and therefore “in Jerusalem.” Jerusalem is being referred to by the name of something closely associated with it, the mountain that the city is built on. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	16	qz7p	bita-humanbehavior	יִשְׁתּ֥וּ כָֽל־הַ⁠גּוֹיִ֖ם תָּמִ֑יד	1	all the nations shall drink continually	Here once again drinking is a metaphor for punishment. Alternate translation: “I will punish them severely.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-humanbehavior]])
OBA	1	16	a8v3	figs-doublet	וְ⁠שָׁת֣וּ וְ⁠לָע֔וּ וְ⁠הָי֖וּ כְּ⁠ל֥וֹא הָיֽוּ	1	And they will drink, and they will swallow, and they will become like they never existed	These two words mean something similar and are used together to intensify the meaning. (See: Doublet) Alternate translation: “I will punish them severely.”
OBA	1	17	cc36	figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠בְ⁠הַ֥ר צִיּ֛וֹן תִּהְיֶ֥ה פְלֵיטָ֖ה	1	But in the mountain of Zion there will be a remnant	The abstract noun **remnant** refers to the people who will still be alive in Jerusalem after Yahweh has finished punishing the other nations. As [1:16](../01/16.md) says, those other nations will disappear completely, but the descendants of Jacob will continue as a people. Alternate translation: “some people in Jerusalem will escape.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
OBA	1	17	y9pz	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠הָ֣יָה קֹ֑דֶשׁ	1	But in the mountain of Zion	This is a figure of speech that refers to Jerusalem by the name of something closely associated with it, the mountain that the city is built on. Alternate translation: “in Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	17	b4sh		וְ⁠הָ֣יָה קֹ֑דֶשׁ	1	and there will be holiness	The word “it” refers to “the mountain of Zion.” Alternate translation: “Jerusalem will be a holy place.”
OBA	1	17	cr13		וְ⁠יָֽרְשׁוּ֙ בֵּ֣ית יַֽעֲקֹ֔ב אֵ֖ת מוֹרָֽשֵׁי⁠הֶם	1	and the house of Jacob will possess their own possessions	“Possessions” is plural because it refers to each of the Israelite families and clans occupying the lands that were supposed to be passed down to them from generation to generation. But since it refers overall to the land that belongs to all of the descendants of Jacob, you can translate it with a singular word if that is clearer. Alternate translation: “the descendants of Jacob will each possess the land that belongs to them”
OBA	1	18	rm2e	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠הָיָה֩ בֵית־יַעֲקֹ֨ב אֵ֜שׁ וּ⁠בֵ֧ית יוֹסֵ֣ף לֶהָבָ֗ה	1	And the house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame	The two expressions have similar meanings. Yahweh is showing that what he is saying is important by saying it more than once. However, the actual descendants of Joseph had been taken into exile by Assyria long before this, so they were not really present at this time. Since both expressions refer to all of the Israelites, you could say as an alternative, “The Israelites will be like a fire. Yes, they will be like a flame.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
OBA	1	18	cr15	bita-manmade	בֵית־יַעֲקֹ֨ב	1	the house of Jacob	Here the word "house" means all the people descended from a particular person. All of the descendants of Jacob are being described figuratively as if they were one household living together. (See: Biblical Imagery – Man-made Objects) Alternate translation: “the Israelites.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]])
OBA	1	18	cr17	bita-manmade	וּ⁠בֵ֧ית יוֹסֵ֣ף	1	and the house of Joseph	The descendants of Joseph are also being described figuratively as if they were one household. Joseph was the son of Jacob, and his descendants made up a large part of the people of Israel. So Yahweh is using his descendants to represent the whole nation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-manmade]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	18	yt8j	bita-manmade	וּ⁠בֵ֤ית עֵשָׂו֙…לְ⁠בֵ֣ית עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	and the house of Esau…for the house of Esau	The descendants of Esau (Edom) are also being described figuratively as if they were one household. (See: Biblical Imagery – Man-made Objects) Alternate translation: “the people of Edom.”
OBA	1	18	cr19	bita-phenom	אֵ֜שׁ…לֶהָבָ֗ה…לְ⁠קַ֔שׁ	1	fire, flame, stubble	Yahweh is saying figuratively that just as fire and flame burn up dry grass until it is all gone, the Israelites who survive will conquer all of Edom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-phenom]])
OBA	1	18	cr21	figs-exmetaphor	אֵ֜שׁ…לֶהָבָ֗ה…לְ⁠קַ֔שׁ	1	fire, flame, stubble	Yahweh is saying that the Israelites are like fire and flame, that the people of Edom are like dry grass, and that the Israelites will do to the people of Edom what fire and flame do to dry grass. This is using the same figurative language to make a series of related points. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])
OBA	1	18	hj8x	figs-metaphor	לְ⁠קַ֔שׁ	1	stubble	This means the dry pieces of plants that are left in the ground after their stalks have been cut. Alternate translation: “dry grass” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
OBA	1	18	cr23	figs-doublet	וְ⁠דָלְק֥וּ בָ⁠הֶ֖ם וַ⁠אֲכָל֑וּ⁠ם	1	And they will burn them, and consume them	“Burn” and “consume” mean almost the same thing. Yahweh uses the words together to mean “burn them until they are all burned up.” Alternate translation: “burn them up completely.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
OBA	1	18	c5jr	figs-explicit	כִּ֥י יְהוָ֖ה דִּבֵּֽר	1	for Yahweh has spoken	This means, “This will certainly happen because I, Yahweh, have said it will happen.” You could use that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	19	x15u		וְ⁠יָרְשׁ֨וּ…וְ⁠יָרְשׁוּ֙	1	And they…will possess…And they will possess	Here “They” appears to refer to the people of Israel in general. Alternate translation: “The Israelites”
OBA	1	19	cr25		וְ⁠יָרְשׁ֨וּ…וְ⁠יָרְשׁוּ֙	1	And they…will possess…And they will possess	This verse as a whole describes people living in different parts of Israel conquering the territories next to them. Alternate translation: “capture.”
OBA	1	19	ep84	figs-metonymy	הַ⁠נֶּ֜גֶב	1	of the Negev	The Negev is the southern Judean wilderness. That location is being used figuratively to mean the people who live there. The people are being described by the name of something closely associated with them, the land they live in. So “the Negev” actually means “the Israelites who live in the southern Judean wilderness.” You could say that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	19	cr27	figs-synecdoche	הַ֣ר עֵשָׂ֗ו	1	the mountain of Esau	This was one of the mountains in Edom. Yahweh is referring to the whole territory by the name of one prominent part of it. Alternate translation: “the land of Edom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
OBA	1	19	m7qk	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁפֵלָה֙	1	they of the Shephelah	The Shephelah means the western foothills in the land of Israel. That location is being used figuratively to mean the people who live there. The people are being described by the name of something closely associated with them, the land they live in. So “the Shephelah” actually means “the Israelites who live in the western foothills.” You could say that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	19	cr29	figs-metonymy	פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים	1	the Philistines	This means, “the region of Phoenicia.” You could say that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	19	gup4	figs-personification	וּ⁠בִנְיָמִ֖ן	1	Benjamin	This means “the people of the tribe of Benjamin.” All the people are being portrayed as if they were a single person, their ancestor. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])
OBA	1	19	cr31	figs-synecdoche	הַ⁠גִּלְעָֽד	1	Gilead	This means “the region east of the Jordan River.” You could say that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

OBA	1	20	cr33	figs-explicit	וְ⁠גָלֻ֣ת	1	And the exile	Yahweh is saying that these people will return, and they will conquer territories as well. You could say that explicitly, for example, “The people who were captured and taken away from their homes will return, and they will capture …” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
OBA	1	20	t8hm		הַֽ⁠חֵל	1	host	This means “a large number of people.” You could say that as an alternate translation.
OBA	1	20	cr35	bita-hq	לִ⁠בְנֵ֨י יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל	1	the sons of Israel	This actually means “the descendants of Israel.” Alternate translation: “the people of Israel.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/bita-hq]])

OBA	1	20	u5t1	figs-metonymy	וְ⁠גָלֻ֥ת יְרוּשָׁלִַ֖ם	1	and the exile of Jerusalem	This means “the people of Israel who were captured and taken away from Jerusalem.” You could say that as an alternate translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	20	x6yt	translate-names	בִּ⁠סְפָרַ֑ד	1	Sepharad	This is the name of a place whose location is unknown. Some experts suggest that it refers to the city of Sardis in the region of Lydia. (See: How to Translate Names) Alternate translation: “They now live in Sepharad.”

Even though the mountain of Zion is a figurative name for Jerusalem, it would be good to say something like “high” here, reflecting the imagery of “mountain.” Edom boasted that it was up high and no one could bring it down, but Yahweh is saying that he will bring it down and place his own people up high instead.
OBA	1	21	hyg2		מֽוֹשִׁעִים֙	1	saviors	This means Israelite military leaders whom God will use to defeat the nation of Edom. Alternate translation: “military leaders.”
OBA	1	21	cr43	figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠הַ֣ר צִיּ֔וֹן	1	the mountain of Zion	Yahweh is referring to Jerusalem figuratively by the name of something closely associated with it, the mountain that the city is built on. Alternate translation: “Jerusalem” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
OBA	1	21	cr45	figs-synecdoche	הַ֣ר עֵשָׂ֑ו	1	the mountain of Esau	This phrase refers to the mountainous territory where Esau, the brother of Jacob, went and settled. So it means “the hill country that came to belong to Esau and his descendants.” Alternate translation: “the land of Edom.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
