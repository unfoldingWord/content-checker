PHP	front	intro	pv9j			0		# Introduction to Philippians<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of the Philippians<br><br>1. Greeting, thanksgiving and prayer (1:1-11)<br>1. Paul’s report on his ministry (1:12-26)<br>1. Instructions<br>- To be steadfast (1:27-30)<br>- To be united (2:1-2)<br>- To be humble (2:3-11)<br>- To work out our salvation with God working in you (2:12-13)<br>- To be innocent and light (2:14-18)<br>1. Timothy and Epaphroditus (2:19-30)<br>1. Warning about false teachers (3:1-4:1)<br>1. Personal instruction (4:2-5)<br>1. Rejoice and do not be anxious (4:4-6)<br>1. Final remarks<br>- Values (4:8-9)<br>- Contentment (4:10-20)<br>- Final Greetings (4:21-23)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book Philippians?<br><br>Paul wrote Philippians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome.<br><br>### What is the Book of Philippians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the believers in Philippi, a city in Macedonia. He wrote it to thank the Philippians for the gift they had sent him. He wanted to tell them about how he was doing in prison and to encourage them to rejoice even if they are suffering. He also wrote to them about a man named Epaphroditus. He was the one who brought the gift to Paul. While visiting Paul, Epaphroditus became ill. So, Paul decided to send him back to Philippi. Paul encouraged the believers in Philippi to welcome and to be kind to Epaphroditus when he returns.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “Philippians.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Letter to the Church in Philippi,” or “A Letter to the Christians in Philippi.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the city of Philippi like?<br><br>Philip, the father of Alexander the Great, founded Philippi in the region of Macedonia. This meant that the citizens of Philippi were also considered citizens of Rome. The people of Philippi were proud of being citizens of Rome. But Paul told the believers that they are citizens of heaven (3:20).<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. The word “you” is almost always plural and refers to the believers in Philippi. The exception to this is 4:3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### Who were the “enemies of the cross of Christ” (3:18) in this letter?<br><br>The “enemies of the cross of Christ” were probably people who called themselves believers, but they did not obey God’s commands. They thought that freedom in Christ meant that believers could do whatever they desired and God would not punish them (3:19).<br><br>### Why were the words “joy” and “rejoice” frequently used in this letter?<br><br>Paul was in prison when he wrote this letter (1:7). Even though he suffered, Paul said many times that he was joyful because God had been kind to him through Jesus Christ. He wanted to encourage his readers to have the same trust in Jesus Christ. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])<br><br>### What does Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?<br><br>This kind of expression occurs in 1:1, 8, 13, 14, 26, 27; 2:1, 5, 19, 24, 29; 3:1, 3, 9, 14; 4:1, 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, 19, 21. Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. See the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Philippians?<br><br>* Some versions have “Amen” at the end of the final verse in the letter (4:23). The ULT, UST, and other many modern versions do not. If “Amen” is included, it should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that it is probably not original to the Book of Philippians.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
PHP	1	intro	kd3g			0		# Philippians 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Paul includes a prayer in the beginning of this letter. At that time, religious leaders sometimes began informal letters with a prayer.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The day of Christ<br>This probably refers to the day when Christ returns. Paul often connected the return of Christ with motivating godly living. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/godly]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. This statement in verse 21 is a paradox: “to die is gain.” In verse 23 Paul explains why this is true. ([Philippians 1:21](../../php/01/21.md))
PHP	1	1	c255	figs-you		0	General Information:	Paul and Timothy wrote this letter to the church at Philippi. Because Paul writes later in the letter saying “I,” it is generally assumed that he is the author and that Timothy, who is with him, writes as Paul speaks. All instances of “you” and “your” in the letter refer to the believers in the Philippian church and are plural. The word “our” probably refers to all believers in Christ, including Paul, Timothy, and the Philippian believers.

PHP	2	intro	ixw8			0		# Philippians 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations, like the ULT, set apart the lines of verses 6-11.

PHP	2	1	xye5			0	Connecting Statement:	Paul advises the believers to have unity and humility and reminds them of Christ’s example.

PHP	2	8	t8a6	figs-metaphor	γενόμενος ὑπήκοος μέχρι θανάτου	1	became obedient to the point of death	Paul speaks of death here in a figurative way.

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Dogs<br>The people of the ancient Near East used dogs as an image to refer to people in a negative way. Not all cultures use the term “dogs” in this way.<br><br>### Resurrected Bodies<br>We know very little about what people will be like in heaven. Paul teaches here that Christians will have some kind of glorious body and will be free from sin.

PHP	3	2	yr9n	figs-metaphor	τοὺς κύνας	1	dogs	The word “dogs” was used by the Jews to refer to those who were not Jews. They were considered unclean. Paul speaks of the false teachers as though they were dogs, to insult them.

If anyone thinks he has confidence in the flesh, I could have even more	This is a hypothetical situation that Paul does not believe is possible.

He speaks of this praise as if he had viewed it in the past as a businessman’s profit. Alternate translation: “anything that other Jews praised me for” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
PHP	3	7	lb8f		κέρδη…ζημίαν	1	profit…loss	These are common business terms. If many people in your culture do not understand formal business terms, you could translate these terms as “things that made my life better” and “things that made my life worse.”
PHP	3	7	y1sg	figs-metaphor	ταῦτα ἥγημαι…ζημίαν	1	I have considered them as loss	Paul speaks of that praise as if he were now viewing it as a business loss instead of a profit.

PHP	3	8	zi6f		μενοῦνγε	1	In fact	“Really” or “Truly”
PHP	3	8	qdh7	figs-explicit	καὶ ἡγοῦμαι	1	now I count	The word “now” emphasizes how Paul has changed since he quit being a Pharisee and became a believer in Christ. Alternate translation: “now that I have trusted in Christ, I count” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
PHP	3	8	e1fp	figs-metaphor	ἡγοῦμαι πάντα ζημίαν εἶναι	1	I count all things to be loss	Paul is continuing the business metaphor from [Philippians 3:7](../03/07.md), saying it is worthless to trust in anything other than Christ.

PHP	3	9	qw6g		ἀλλὰ τὴν διὰ πίστεως Χριστοῦ	1	but that which is through faith in Christ	The word “that” refers to righteousness. Paul knows that he can become righteous only by believing in Christ. Alternate translation: “but having the righteousness that comes by believing in Christ”

PHP	3	12	xk5q			0	Connecting Statement:	Paul urges the believers at Philippi to follow his present example because of heaven and the new bodies that wait for believers.
