JON	front	intro	hk4p			0		# Introduction to Jonah<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Jonah<br><br>1. Jonah tries to run away from Yahweh (1:1-2:10)<br>    - Jonah disobeys Yahweh’s first call to go to Nineveh (1:1–3)<br>    - Jonah and the Gentile sailors (1:4–16)<br>    - Yahweh provides a large fish to swallow Jonah, and he prays and is rescued (1:17–2:10)<br>1. Jonah in Nineveh (3:1-4:11)<br>    - Yahweh again calls Jonah to go to Nineveh, and Jonah proclaims Yahweh’s message (3:1–4)<br>    - Nineveh repents (3:5-9)<br>    - Yahweh decides not to destroy Nineveh (3:10)<br>    - Jonah is very angry with Yahweh (4:1–3)<br>    - Yahweh teaches Jonah about grace and mercy (4:4–11)<br><br>### What is the Book of Jonah about?<br><br>Jonah, son of Amittai, was a prophet from Gath Hepher (2 Kings 14:25). This book tells about what happened to Jonah. It tells how Yahweh shows mercy and grace to Gentiles. It also tells how the Ninevites repented and called out to Yahweh for mercy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]])<br><br>Yahweh sent Jonah to warn the people of Nineveh that he was ready to punish them. Yahweh said that if they would repent he would not harm them. However, Jonah was an Israelite and he did not want the Ninevites to repent. So Jonah tried to sail away in the opposite direction instead of doing what Yahweh told him to do. But Yahweh stopped him by sending a storm and a large fish to swallow him.<br><br>Jonah repented and warned the Ninevites. As a result, Yahweh taught him that he is concerned about all people, not just the Israelites.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book is traditionally titled **The Book of Jonah** or just **Jonah**. Translators may decide to use a clearer title such as **The Book about Jonah**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Jonah?<br><br>Jonah was probably involved in the writing of this book. However, scholars do not know who actually wrote it.<br><br>Jonah lived in the northern kingdom of Israel. He prophesied sometime between 800 and 750 B.C. during the reign of King Jeroboam II.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What was the nation of Assyria?<br><br>During the time of Jonah, Assyria was the most powerful kingdom in the ancient Near East. Nineveh was the capital city of Assyria.<br><br>Assyria was cruel to its enemies. Eventually, Yahweh punished the Assyrians for the wicked things they did.<br><br>### Did Assyria convert to Judaism?<br><br>Some scholars think that the Assyrians started worshiping Yahweh alone. However, most scholars think they continued to worship other false gods. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])
JON	1	intro	xvp2			0		# Jonah 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>The narrative of this chapter starts abruptly. This could cause difficulty for the translator. The translator should not attempt to smooth this introduction unless absolutely necessary.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Miracle<br><br>In verse [Jonah 17](./17.md), there is the mention of **a great fish**. It may be difficult to imagine a sea creature big enough to swallow a man whole and who then survives for three days and nights inside. Translators should not try to explain miraculous events in an attempt to make it easier to understand. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Situational irony<br><br>There is an ironic situation in this chapter. This means that people do or say things that are the opposite of what one would expect them to do. Jonah is a prophet of God and should endeavor to do God’s will. Instead, he is running away from God. Although the Gentile sailors are not Israelites, they act out of faith and fear of Yahweh when sending Jonah to a certain death by throwing him overboard. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/willofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])<br><br>### Sea<br><br>People in the ancient Near East also saw the sea as chaotic and did not trust it. Some of the gods they worshiped were gods of the sea. Jonah’s people, the Hebrews, feared the sea greatly. However, Jonah’s fear of Yahweh was not enough to keep him from going into a ship and sailing to get away from Yahweh. His actions are contrasted by the actions of the Gentiles. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Even though no one knows for sure where Tarshish was, the writer assumes that the reader knows that Jonah had to face away from Nineveh to go there.

JON	2	intro	ae4k			0		# Jonah 02 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter begins with a prayer by Jonah, and many translators have chosen to set it apart by setting its lines farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. Translators can follow this practice, but they are not obligated to.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sea<br><br>This chapter contains many terms from the sea.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Poetry<br><br>Prayers in Scripture often contain a poetic form. Poetry frequently uses metaphors to communicate something with a special meaning. For example, since Jonah was in a fish in the sea, being trapped is compared to a prison. Jonah is overwhelmed by the depth of the sea and expresses this by speaking about at the **base of the mountains** and in the **belly of Sheol**. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Repentance<br><br>Scholars are divided over whether Jonah’s repentance was genuine or whether he was trying to save his life. In light of his attitude in chapter 4, it is uncertain if he was genuinely repentant. If possible, it is best for translators to avoid making a definitive stance on whether Jonah’s repentance was genuine. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/save]])
JON	2	1	alr2		יְהוָ֖ה אֱלֹהָ֑י⁠ו	1	Yahweh his God	This means **Yahweh, the God he worshiped**. The word **his** does not mean that Jonah owned God.
JON	2	2	al5b		וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	And he said	**Jonah said**
JON	2	2	jdrc	writing-poetry	קָ֠רָאתִי מִ⁠צָּ֥רָה לִ֛⁠י אֶל־יְהוָ֖ה וַֽ⁠יַּעֲנֵ֑⁠נִי	1	I cried out to Yahweh from my distress, and he answered me	This line begins a poem describing Jonah’s experience and prayer in the belly of the fish. The poem does not give the exact words that Jonah prayed at the time because the poem was written later, describing Jonah’s experience in the fish, his prayer, and God’s answer as if they had already happened in the past. This first line of the poem can be understood in one of two ways: either as being addressed to Yahweh as part of the description of the prayer; or as being addressed to another person as an introduction to the description of the prayer. See also the Note concerning the phrase “Salvation belongs to Yahweh!” in [2:9](../02/09/jdrh). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])

JON	2	2	w8wn	figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בֶּ֧טֶן שְׁא֛וֹל	1	from the belly of Sheol	**from the center of Sheol** or **from the deep part of Sheol**. Possible meanings include: (1) Jonah was speaking of being in the belly of the fish as being in Sheol; or (2) Jonah believed that he was about to die and go to Sheol; or (3) He was speaking as if he already had died and gone to Sheol. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JON	2	2	ab77	translate-names	שְׁא֛וֹל	1	Sheol	**Sheol** was the name of the place where people went after they died. It was thought to be a shadowy world located somewhere under the ground. The New Testament equivalent seems to be “Hades,” where the dead wait for judgment (see Rev. 20:13). If your language has a word for this place, you may want to use it here, or borrow the word “Sheol.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
JON	2	2	jdrd	figs-idiom	שָׁמַ֥עְתָּ קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	you heard my voice	This phrase probably has both a literal and a figurative meaning. The phrase probably means literally that Yahweh heard Jonah’s voice while he was praying inside the belly of the fish. However, the phrase “to hear someone’s voice” in the Old Testament often means “to listen and obey (comply).” In this context, Jonah is expressing that Yahweh both heard him and acted to save him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JON	2	3	glp2		בִּ⁠לְבַ֣ב יַמִּ֔ים	1	into the heart of the seas	Here the term **heart** is a metaphor for “being inside” something. The phrase “in the heart of” means to be “in the middle of” or “completely surrounded by” sea water. Alternate translation: “in the middle of the sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JON	2	3	p8fd		וְ⁠נָהָ֖ר יְסֹבְבֵ֑⁠נִי	1	a current surrounded me	**the sea water closed in around me**
JON	2	3	c6jx	figs-doublet	מִשְׁבָּרֶ֥י⁠ךָ וְ⁠גַלֶּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	your billows and your waves	Both of these are disturbances on the surface of the ocean. They could be combined into one term, such as “waves” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
JON	2	4	jdr5	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	But as for me,	This expression shows that there is a contrast between the actions of Yahweh, which Jonah had just talked about, and his own response. Alternate translation: “Then I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JON	2	4	x1w9	figs-activepassive	נִגְרַ֖שְׁתִּי	1	I have been driven out	This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “You drove me out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
JON	2	4	z1yx	figs-metonymy	מִ⁠נֶּ֣גֶד עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	from before your eyes	Here **eyes** is a metonym meaning seeing, and seeing is a metonym for the knowledge, notice, and attention of God. Alternate translation: “from before you” or “from your presence” or “where you do not notice me” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JON	2	4	b8vk		אַ֚ךְ אוֹסִ֣יף לְ⁠הַבִּ֔יט אֶל־הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	yet I might again look toward your holy temple	Jonah still has hope that, in spite of all that he is going through, God will allow him to see the temple in Jerusalem again.
JON	2	5	abc2	figs-parallelism	אֲפָפ֤וּ⁠נִי מַ֨יִם֙ עַד־נֶ֔פֶשׁ תְּה֖וֹם יְסֹבְבֵ֑⁠נִי	1	Water had closed around me even as far as life; the deep was surrounding me;	Jonah uses two similar phrases to express the severity and hopelessness of his situation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
JON	2	5	rf4b		מַ֨יִם֙	1	Water	Here **Water** refers to the sea.
JON	2	5	ca31		עַד־נֶ֔פֶשׁ	1	even as far as life	Here the Hebrew term **life** can possibly mean **my life** or **my neck** or **my spirit**. In any case, the water was threatening to end his life. Alternate translation: “up to my neck” or “as far as my spirit”
JON	2	5	nr3v		תְּה֖וֹם יְסֹבְבֵ֑⁠נִי	1	the deep was surrounding me	**deep water was all around me**
JON	2	5	p1fw		ס֖וּף	1	seaweed	**seaweed** is grass that grows in the sea
JON	2	6	z36i	figs-metaphor	הָ⁠אָ֛רֶץ בְּרִחֶ֥י⁠הָ בַעֲדִ֖⁠י לְ⁠עוֹלָ֑ם	1	the earth with its bars was around me forever	Here Jonah uses a metaphor to compare the earth to a prison. Alternate translation: “the earth was like a prison that was about to lock me in forever” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JON	2	6	dc3r	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תַּ֧עַל מִ⁠שַּׁ֛חַת חַיַּ֖⁠י	1	but you brought up my life from the pit	Here the term **pit** has two possible meanings: (1) this could be a way to describe being in a very deep place underground or underwater or (2) this could be a metaphor meaning the place of the dead (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]]). In either case, the term probably refers to the fact that Jonah felt certain that he would die. Alternate translation: “But you saved me from dying in a deep place” or “But you saved my life from the place of the dead”
JON	2	6	i3mx		יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהָֽ⁠י	1	Yahweh, my God!	In some languages, it may be more natural to put this at the beginning of the sentence or next to the word **you**.
JON	2	7	jdr6	grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	בְּ⁠הִתְעַטֵּ֤ף עָלַ⁠י֙ נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	When my spirit fainted upon me,	This phrase could mean either: (1) Jonah was already in the process of dying when he remembered Yahweh; or (2) Jonah had given up hope of being rescued and resigned himself to the fact that he would die. Alternate translation: “When my life was fainting away from me” or “When my spirit inside me had fainted” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous]])
JON	2	7	l2b6		אֶת־יְהוָ֖ה זָכָ֑רְתִּי	1	I remembered Yahweh	Since Jonah was praying to Yahweh, it might be more clear in some languages to say “I thought about you, Yahweh” or “Yahweh, I thought about you.”
JON	2	7	ue9g	figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תָּב֤וֹא אֵלֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תְּפִלָּתִ֔⁠י אֶל־הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	and my prayer came to you, to your holy temple	Jonah speaks as if his prayers could travel to God and his temple. This means that God heard his prayer and responded to it. Alternate translation: “then you in your holy temple heard my prayer” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
JON	2	7	jdrf	figs-metonymy	הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁ⁠ךָ	1	your holy temple	Here the term “holy temple” may have either a literal or a figurative meaning, or perhaps both. Jonah might be speaking about the literal temple in Jerusalem, or he might be speaking about God’s dwelling place in Heaven. See the UST. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
JON	2	8	jdre		נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	my spirit	Here the Hebrew term **my spirit** could also mean **my life**.
JON	2	8	u1l9	figs-idiom	מְשַׁמְּרִ֖ים הַבְלֵי־שָׁ֑וְא	1	Those who give attention to empty vanities	Here the term “empty vanities” is probably an idiom referring to idols of false gods. Alternate translation: “Those who give attention to useless idols” or “Those who pay attention to useless gods” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JON	2	8	fac9		חַסְדָּ֖⁠ם יַעֲזֹֽבוּ	1	forsake their covenant faithfulness	Here, **covenant faithfulness** could refer to (1) the faithfulness of God or (2) the faithfulness of the people. Therefore, it could mean (1) “are rejecting you, who would be faithful to them” or (2) “are abandoning their commitment to you”
JON	2	9	q3yb	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י	1	But as for me,	This expression shows that there is a contrast between the people Jonah had just spoken about and himself. They paid attention to useless gods, but he would worship Yahweh. Alternate translation: “But I” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
JON	2	9	nfd2		בְּ⁠ק֤וֹל תּוֹדָה֙ אֶזְבְּחָה־לָּ֔⁠ךְ	1	I will sacrifice to you with a voice of thanksgiving	This phrase probably means that Jonah would thank God while he offered a sacrifice to him. It is not clear whether Jonah planned to thank God by singing or shouting joyfully.
JON	2	9	jdrh		יְשׁוּעָ֖תָ⁠ה לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1	Salvation belongs to Yahweh	This last line of the poem can be understood in one of two ways: either (1) as being addressed to Yahweh as part of the description of the prayer; or (2) as being addressed to another person as a conclusion to the description of the prayer. See also the Note concerning the phrase “I cried out to Yahweh from my distress…” in [2:2](../02/02/jdrc).
JON	2	9	r4j4	figs-abstractnouns	יְשׁוּעָ֖תָ⁠ה לַ⁠יהוָֽה	1	Salvation belongs to Yahweh	This can be reworded so that the abstract noun **salvation** is expressed as the verb **save**. Alternate translation: “Yahweh is the one who saves people” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
JON	2	10	dz3j		אֶל־הַ⁠יַּבָּשָֽׁה	1	onto the dry land	**upon the ground** or **onto the shore**
JON	3	intro	z3ut			0		# Jonah 03 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter returns to a narrative of Jonah’s life.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Animals<br><br>According to the king’s proclamation, the animals had to participate in the fast he ordered. This most likely reflects their pagan mindset. There was nothing in the law of Moses that instructed the people to have the animals participate in any religious acts. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Size of Nineveh<br><br>When the author talks about the size of Nineveh, the measurements he gives are confusing. The phrase **three days’ journey** is ambiguous in Hebrew, as many scholars have remarked. In Jonah’s day, cities were not as big as they are today. So although Nineveh was a big city, it was not as big as most modern cities.<br><br>### God repenting or relenting<br><br>The last verse of this chapter says, **So then God changed his mind about the punishment that he had said he would do to them, and he did not do it**. This concept of God changing His mind may seem inconsistent with the fact that God’s character and his plans do not change. But this whole book is written from a human viewpoint and so it presents the actions of God as Jonah saw them. God had told Jonah to warn the Ninevites of judgment for their sin. <br><br>Yahweh is just, but he is also merciful. Because the Ninevites repented, God did not follow through with a judgment in this instance, and Jonah described that in a human way as “changing his mind.” The reader understands that this was God’s plan from the beginning. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/justice]], [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/judge]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])
JON	3	1	jdr7	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֧י דְבַר־יְהוָ֛ה	1	The word of Yahweh came	This phrase introduces the second half of the story of Jonah. The same phrase introduces the first half of the story (1:1). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
JON	3	1	xj6n	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְהִ֧י דְבַר־יְהוָ֛ה	1	The word of Yahweh came	This is an idiom meaning that Yahweh spoke in some way.. See how you translated this in [1:1](../01/01/ll6c). Alternate translation: “Yahweh spoke his message” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JON	3	2	ve4i		ק֛וּם לֵ֥ךְ אֶל־נִֽינְוֵ֖ה הָ⁠עִ֣יר הַ⁠גְּדוֹלָ֑ה	1	Get up, go to Nineveh, the great city	**Go to the large and important city of Nineveh**

Alternate translation: **This time Jonah obeyed Yahweh and went to Nineveh** or “So Jonah left the beach and went to Nineveh, as Yahweh had commanded him” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
JON	3	3	g4nk	figs-metonymy	כִּ⁠דְבַ֣ר יְהוָ֑ה	1	the word of Yahweh	**the message of Yahweh** or **the command of Yahweh**

JON	3	4	r94k		וַ⁠יִּקְרָא֙ וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֔ר	1	and he called out and said	**and he proclaimed** or **and he shouted**

JON	3	6	ab91	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יֵּ֖שֶׁב עַל־הָ⁠אֵֽפֶר	1	and sat down on the ash heap	Sitting in ashes was a way to show great humility and sorrow. In this case, it was to show how sorry he was for his sin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
JON	3	7	v29b		וַ⁠יַּזְעֵ֗ק וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙…לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	And he proclaimed and spoke	**He sent out an official announcement that said** or **He sent his messengers to announce**

What the people were to pray for can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “and they must cry out loudly to God and ask for mercy” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JON	3	8	n3ls		הֶ⁠חָמָ֖ס אֲשֶׁ֥ר בְּ⁠כַפֵּי⁠הֶֽם	1	the violence that is in his hands	Here **hands** is a metonym meaning doing. This refers to the violence that the people of Nineveh were doing. Alternate translation: “the violent things that he has done” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JON	3	9	wbt6	figs-rquestion	מִֽי־יוֹדֵ֣עַ	1	Who knows?	The king used this rhetorical question to get the people to think about something that is possible, but uncertain: that if they would stop sinning, God might not kill them. It could be translated as a statement: “We do not know”. Or it could be stated as a word and be part of the next sentence: “Perhaps”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JON	3	9	z3jj	figs-metaphor	יָשׁ֔וּב וְ⁠נִחַ֖ם הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	This god might turn back and have compassion	Here the author speaks of God changing his mind about bringing judgment as if God were turning around and walking in the opposite direction.

JON	3	10	ab85		וַ⁠יִּנָּ֣חֶם הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֗ים עַל־הָ⁠רָעָ֛ה	1	And God relented in regard to the evil	The word translated as “evil” here is very broad, including moral evil, physical evil, and everything that is bad. It is the same word used in the previous sentence (and verse 8) to describe the actions of the Ninevites. The author is showing that when people repent of moral evil, God relents of doing physical evil (punishment). God never does moral evil. If this is clear in your language, you may want to use the same word in both sentences. If that is not clear, you may want to use different words.
JON	3	10	it1a	figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֥א עָשָֽׂה	1	and he did not do it	What God did not do can be made explicit. Alternate translation: “and he did not punish them” or “and he did not destroy them” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
JON	4	intro	ys57			0		# Jonah 04 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Jonah continues the narrative while bringing the book to what seems like an unusual end. This emphasizes that the book is not really about Jonah. It is about God’s desire to be merciful to everyone, whether Jew or pagan. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/mercy]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Prophecy not coming true<br><br>### It is important to see the relationship between a prophet and Yahweh. A prophet was to prophesy for Yahweh, and his words must come true. According to the law of Moses, if that did not happen, the penalty was death, because that shows that he was not a real prophet. But when Jonah told the city of Nineveh that it was going to be destroyed in forty days, it did not happen at that time. This is because God reserves the right to be merciful. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])<br><br>## Jonah’s anger<br><br> <br><br>### When God did not destroy Nineveh, Jonah was angry with God because Jonah hated the people of Nineveh. They were enemies of Israel. But God wanted Jonah, and the readers of this book, to learn that God loves all people.<br><br>### Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>As in other places, Jonah asks rhetorical questions to show how angry he was at Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Parallel to Mount Sinai<br><br>In verse 2, Jonah attributes a series of characteristics to God. A Jewish reader of this book would recognize this as a formula Moses used in speaking about God when he was meeting God on Mount Sinai. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### God’s grace<br><br>When Jonah went outside the city, he got very hot and God graciously provided some relief through the plant. God was trying to teach Jonah through an object lesson. It is important for the reader to see this clearly. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]])

Jonah used this rhetorical question to tell God how angry he was. If it is more clear, this can be made into a statement. Alternate translation: “Ah, Yahweh, this is what I said when I was still in my own country!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
JON	4	2	ab79	figs-explicit	יְהוָה֙ הֲ⁠לוֹא־זֶ֣ה דְבָרִ֗⁠י עַד־הֱיוֹתִ⁠י֙ עַל־אַדְמָתִ֔⁠י	1	Yahweh, was this not my word while I was in my country?
