GEN	front	intro	d9wn			0		# Introduction to Genesis<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Genesis<br><br>1. From the Creation to the Tower of Babel<br>- The account of the creation of the heavens and the earth (1:1–4:26)<br>- The account of Adam (5:1–6:8)<br>- The account of Noah (6:9–11:9)<br>- The account of Shem (11:10–11:26)<br>- The account of Terah (11:27–11:32)<br>1. The accounts of the Patriarchs<br>- The account of Abraham (12:1-25:11)<br>- The account of Ishmael (25:12–25:18)<br>- The account of Isaac, focusing on Jacob (25:19–35:29)<br>- The account of Esau (36:1–37:1)<br>- The account of Jacob, focusing on Joseph (37:2–50:26)<br><br>### What is Genesis about?<br><br>Genesis begins with the early years of creation. It tells about God creating heaven, earth, and the first humans. It also tells about the first time humans sinned. This caused humans to be separated from God and to eventually die. Genesis 1-11 briefly tells about other important events that occurred over many hundreds of years. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/death]])<br><br>Genesis is also about the beginning of God’s people. Genesis 12-50 tells about how God remained faithful to Abraham and his descendants. Abraham’s descendants became known as the Hebrews and later as the Israelites. These people would worship Yahweh and be his people.<br><br>Genesis ends with Abraham’s descendants living in Egypt with the hope of returning one day to the Promised Land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>“Genesis” means “beginning,” so translators should express this idea in their title. Titles such as “The Beginning of Things” may be suitable. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote Genesis?<br><br>The writers of both the Old and New Testaments presented Moses as being very involved with writing the book of Genesis. Since ancient times, both Jews and Christians have thought that Moses wrote Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What are the covenants mentioned in Genesis?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill.<br><br>God made three covenants in Genesis. In the covenant with Adam, God promised to bless Adam and cause him to prosper. Adam was not allowed to eat fruit from the tree of knowledge of good and evil. God promised that Adam would die if he disobeyed what he commanded.<br><br>In the covenant with Noah, God promised to never again destroy the world with a flood.<br><br>In the covenant with Abraham, God promised to make Abraham’s descendants into a great nation. He also promised to protect them and to give them a land of their own.<br><br>### What was God’s purpose for the book of Genesis?<br><br>The book of Genesis says that God created a very good world. However, the world became cursed because human beings began to sin. But Genesis shows that God continues to have complete control over the world.<br><br>Genesis also describes the start of God’s plan to bless the whole world again. This is shown when God makes a covenant with Abraham. With this covenant, God chose Abraham and his descendants to be his people. God promised to bless the world through Abraham’s descendants.<br><br>### What was the custom for inheritance as described by Genesis?<br><br>There are several passages in Genesis that show the customs of a father who is about to die passing on a blessing to his son. Abraham blessed his son, Isaac, and made him the ancestor of the people of Israel. However, Ishmael, Abraham’s other son, did not receive that same divine blessing. Likewise, Isaac’s older son Esau did not receive the blessing. Isaac’s younger son, Jacob, received it instead. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/inherit]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])<br><br>Also, it was the custom for a man to divide among his sons his material wealth and land. All his sons received equal portions except the oldest son. The firstborn son received twice as much. His portion was called a double portion. Esau gave up his right to receive the double portion.<br><br>### How does Genesis present sin and evil?<br><br>Genesis presents sin as doing things that are against God’s word and God’s ways. It presents evil as the opposite of good.<br><br>Sin and evil have affected all people. This started when Adam disobeyed God in the Garden of Eden.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What is one way in which Genesis marks the beginning of important sections?<br><br>Genesis uses one Hebrew phrase that the ULT translates as “this is the record of,” “these were the events concerning,” or “these were the descendants of.” The information in these sections may have come from sources much older than Moses. These passages are 2:4; 5:1; 6:9; 10:1; 11:10, 27; 25:12, 19; 36:1, 9; 37:2.<br><br>If the translator wants to translate in only two ways, we recommend for most passages a phrase such as, “this is the record about” or “this is information about.” Some passages will be better translated, however, as “These were the descendants of.”<br><br>### Why are the beginnings of some narrative sections in Genesis difficult to translate?<br><br>Often in Genesis, the author first summarizes what is about to happen. Then in the following verses, the author tells the details of what happened. Probable examples of this style occur in Gen. 1:1, 6:22, 18:1, 21:1 and 22:1.<br><br>However, in many languages, it is preferred to write summaries at the end of a narrative. In this case, translators may choose a different approach. For example, in Gen. 1:1 (“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth”), translators may decide to translate like this: “This is about how God made the heavens and the earth in the beginning.”<br><br>### What is the difference between “people,” “peoples,” and “people groups”?<br><br>The word “people” refers to all the individuals who belong to a group, such as “the people of Israel.” The word “peoples” (used in the ULT) refers to multiple groups of people. Each people group might speak their own language, have their own customs, and worships their own gods. Some different peoples in the ancient Near East were those of Israel, Egypt, Edom, Moab, and Ammon.<br><br>The expression “people groups” (used in the UST) means the same thing as “peoples” in the ULT. The translator should use the most equivalent term that is common in the project language.<br><br>### What is the relationship between individuals and peoples that have similar names?<br><br>Many individuals in Genesis eventually had large numbers of descendants who were called after their ancestor’s name. For example, Cush was the name of an individual. But, “Cush” also became the name of nation that his descendants formed. They were called “Cushites.” If possible, when translating these names, the translator should make the individual’s name and the nation’s name similar. Examples of this are “Cush” and “Cushite” or “Moab” and “Moabite.” Otherwise, the translator may say, “the descendants of Cush” or “the descendants of Moab.”<br><br>### What do the phrases “to this day” or “of today” mean?<br><br>These phrases were used by the narrator to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” and “of today” refer to a time already passed. The translator might decide to say, “to this day, at the time when this is being written,” or, “to this day, at the time of writing.” This Hebrew phrase occurs in Gen. 19:37, 19:38, 22:14, 26:33, 32:32, 35:20, 47:26, 48:18.
GEN	1	intro	zb6f			0		# Genesis 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter presents the first account of God creating the world. There is a pattern to this account: “God said…God saw that it was good…This was evening and morning, the first day.” Translators should preserve this pattern in their versions.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The universe<br><br>This account of creation is told within the framework of ancient Hebrew ideas about the universe: the earth was resting with water around it and below it. Over the earth was something like a vast dome, called “an expanse between the waters” (1:6), on top of which was more water. Translators should try to keep these original images in their work, even though readers in their project language might have a completely different idea of what the universe is like.<br><br>### Evening and morning<br><br>Genesis 1 presents the ancient Hebrew idea of a day: it begins with sunset, lasts through the night and continues through the daylight hours until the next sunset. This pattern should be preserved in translation, even if readers in the project language define “day” differently.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “In the beginning”<br><br>Some languages and cultures speak of the world as if it has always existed, as if it had no beginning. But “very long ago” is different from “in the beginning,” and you need to be sure that your translation communicates correctly.<br><br>### “God said, ‘Let there be’”<br><br>This expression occurs often in this chapter. It can be difficult to translate, because God is not shown as talking to a particular person. If God is talking to a thing, it is something not yet in existence. Translators should find the most natural way in the project language to signal the idea that God spoke things into existence; he created the world and the things in it by simply commanding that they should exist.

GEN	1	25	s88h			0	He saw that it was good	Here “it” refers to the living creatures on the earth. See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:4](../01/04.md).
GEN	1	26	x8fd	figs-pronouns		0	Let us make	The word “us” here refers to God. God was saying what he intended to do. The pronoun “us” is plural. Possible reasons for the plural use are (1) the plural form suggests that God is discussing something with the angels that make up his heavenly court or (2) the plural form foreshadows the later New Testament implications that God exists in the form of the Holy Trinity. Some translate it as “Let me make” or “I will make.” If you do this, consider adding a footnote to say that the word is plural. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
GEN	1	26	xk37			0	man	human beings
GEN	1	26	kt75	figs-doublet		0	in our image, after our likeness	These two phrases mean the same thing and emphasize that God made mankind to be like him.

GEN	1	27	r7sx			0	God created man	The way that God created man was different from the way he created everything else. Do not specify that he created man by simply speaking, as in the preceding verses.
GEN	1	28	uiq2			0	God blessed them	The word “them” refers to the man and woman God had created.
GEN	1	28	tfr1	figs-doublet		0	Be fruitful, and multiply	God told the man and the woman to produce more people like themselves so that there would be many of them. The word “multiply” explains how they are to be “fruitful.” See how you translated this in [Genesis 1:22](../01/22.md). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	1	28	a7nj			0	Fill the earth	Fill the earth with people.
GEN	1	30	j3is			0	General Information:	God continues speaking.
GEN	1	30	vc53			0	every bird of the heavens	“all the birds that fly in the sky”
GEN	1	30	etp6			0	that has the breath of life	“that breathes.” This phrase emphasizes that these animals had a different kind of life than the plants. Plants do not breathe, and were to be used as food for the animals. Here “life” means physical life.
GEN	1	30	di9p			0	It was so	“It happened like that” or “That is what happened.” What God commanded happened just as he said it should. This phrase appears throughout the chapter and has the same meaning. See how you translated it in [Genesis 1:7](../01/07.md).

GEN	2	intro	nfp7			0		# Genesis 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Gen. 2:1-3 ends the first creation account, begun in the previous chapter. The second creation account, beginning in 2:4, is very different, using a more natural, story-telling style instead of following a set formula using repeated phrases. Translators should try to imitate this difference in their versions.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The second creation account in Gen. 2:4-25<br><br>Gen. 2:4-25 presents an account of creation from a different viewpoint than the one given in Gen. 1:1-2:3. This second account should be regarded as filling out the first account, not as conflicting with it.<br><br>### Yahweh, the name of God<br><br>“Yahweh,” the personal name of God in the Old Testament, appears for the first time in this chapter. Translators must decide how to represent it in their versions. For 2,000 years, it has been traditional for many Christians to represent it with the term “the Lord.” Indeed, it is demanded by Roman Catholics for their Bible versions to continue doing this. Of course, the disadvantage of using “the Lord” is that this is a title for God, not a personal name. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahweh]])<br><br>Translators who are not producing versions for Roman Catholics can consider transliterating the name “Yahweh,” approximating the name as best as their project languages allow.<br><br>Or translators can consider using expressions for the supreme god that might exist in their project languages, such as, “The Great One,” “The Ruler of All,” “The One who Never Sleeps,” etc. Of course, these are descriptive titles, not personal names, so they suffer from the same disadvantages that “the Lord” has.<br><br>Translators can also consider pairing a transliteration of “Yahweh” with a meaningful title for the supreme god in the project language. Whatever solution is found should be followed consistently when the name “Yahweh” occurs in the Scriptures.<br><br>### The Garden of Eden<br><br>This was not a vegetable garden or cultivated field. Instead, it was probably a large area of land with fruit trees and other plants bearing leaves, etc., that were good to eat. A river flowed out from the Garden of Eden, giving the impression that the Garden was a holy place; in the ancient Near East, temples had gardens and waterways. In Rev. 22:1-2, the throne of God in the New Jerusalem is pictured with a river flowing out from it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])

GEN	3	intro	j7i3			0		# Genesis 03 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter continues the second creation account that began in Gen. 2:4. But a new section of this account begins in 3:1. The ULT reads, “Now the serpent was more shrewd than any other beast of the field which Yahweh God had made,” because this is how the Scriptures introduce the serpent into the account. However, many languages prefer different ways to introduce new characters or things into stories, for example, “One of the wild animals made by God was the serpent” or “This is about the serpent, one of the wild animals that God had made.”<br><br>Scholars typically refer to the events of this chapter as “the fall” or “the fall of man” because sin is introduced into creation. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Curses<br><br>In this chapter, God curses the man, the woman, and the serpent for their sins. In general, cursing is calling down God’s punishment on someone or something. In this chapter, however, it is God himself who is doing the cursing. Of course, he does not call down punishment on the man, the woman, and the serpent from someone else. Instead, he is promising that he himself will punish them. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])<br><br>### Serpent<br>Most scholars believe that the serpent is Satan, even though his name is not used in this chapter. There are other places in Scripture where the serpent is used as an image for Satan. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/satan]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GEN	3	13	fw79	figs-rquestion		0	What is this you have done?	God already knew what the woman had done. When he asked this question, he was giving her the opportunity to tell him about it, and he was expressing his disappointment with what she had done. Many languages use rhetorical questions for scolding or rebuking. If possible, use a form that expresses this disappointment. It can also be translated as a statement. Alternate translation: “You have done a terrible thing.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	3	14	w3bn			0	cursed are you alone	“you alone are cursed.” The word “curse” is first in Hebrew in order to emphasize the contrast between God’s blessing on the animals and this curse on the serpent.

This is also part of the curse formula.
GEN	3	14	p527			0	it is dust that you will eat	“you will eat dust.” The words “it is dust” comes first to emphasize the contrast between the plants above the ground that other animals would eat and the dirty food on the ground that the serpent would eat. This is part of the curse formula.

If “seed” was translated as plural, this can be translated as “they will bruise…their heel”; in this case, consider inserting footnotes to say that the “they” and “their” are used to translate a singular pronoun.

GEN	4	intro	a2f7			0		# Genesis 04 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Most of the text in this chapter is prose, but 4:23-24 is poetry. If the translator should put these two verses into poetic form, or at least into elegant speech, different from the rest of the chapter.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Vengeance<br><br>The theme of vengeance is important in this chapter. Ancient Hebrew society allowed for people to seek revenge if a relative was murdered. After Cain murdered his brother Abel, he thought that he would be helpless against this danger because he had been driven away from God’s protection. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])<br><br>The theme of vengeance continues with the words of Lamech, who had killed someone for injuring him:<br>“I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me. If Cain is avenged seven times as much, truly Lamech will be avenged seventy-seven times as much” (Gen. 4:23b-24).

GEN	7	intro	n23k			0		# Genesis 07 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, the author continues his pattern of statements that summarize events already described, and of repeating events that have already happened. Again, careful translation is necessary so that readers do not think that the same events happened more than one time in the story. Special attention in this regard should be given to 7:5,10,13, and 17.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Clean animals and birds<br><br>Noah sacrificed to Yahweh some of the “clean” animals and birds that he had with him (8:20). These were animals and birds that the Hebrew people would later consider to be fit to eat and to sacrifice to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/clean]])<br><br>### Water underneath and over the earth<br><br>The flood is presented as occurring because of rain pouring out of the sky and because of seawater rising from under the earth. This is because the ancient Hebrews pictured the earth as resting on top of the sea. They also pictured the sky as containing water above the earth that poured down through windows in the sky when God allowed it to rain. Translators should not try to change this picture in order to suit what readers believe about the world. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]])

The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of 9:6-7, which is the poetic part of the quotation, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. They also set apart 9:25-27, which contains two quotations.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 9:6 and 9:25-27.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Man’s relationship to animals<br>There is a noticeable shift in man’s relationship with the animals on the earth. Before the flood, there apparently was harmony between man and the animals. After the flood, the animals fear man and man is permitted to eat the animals, something he was not allowed to do previously. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Life in the blood<br>This chapter introduces the concept that there is life in the blood of an animal and in man. In Hebrew thought, blood represents the life present in a living thing. This is an image used throughout Scripture. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/life]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blood]])<br><br>### Covenant with Noah<br>God made a covenant with Noah. This covenant was an unconditional promise God made to never destroy the whole world with a flood. Rainbows are a perpetual sign of this covenant. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/promise]])<br><br>### A father’s nakedness<br>In Noah’s culture, it was unacceptable to see a father’s nakedness. It was wrong for Ham to show his brothers their father’s nakedness. Ham’s actions were insulting or disrespectful. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth”<br>This is a command that God gives. He expects Noah to obey him.

This means that if a person murders someone, someone else must kill the murderer. However, “blood” is very significant in this passage and should be used in the translation if possible.

GEN	18	intro	ky5w			0		# Genesis 18 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Three men<br>The three men who visited Abraham were probably angels. This is evident from Abraham’s reaction to them. Also, it appears Abraham knew that he was speaking directly to Yahweh through these men. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/angel]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Disbelief<br>When Sarah heard the news that she was going to have a baby, she laughed in disbelief because she was considered too old to have a baby. She also asked a rhetorical question in order to further show her disbelief. This would have been considered an insult to God. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>In his exchange with God, Abraham did not show any sign of unbelief. Instead, he is asking God for mercy because he trusted in the character of God. He does not question God’s power to accomplish things as Sarah had done. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Sarah’s age<br><br>It should be apparent that Sarah was physically no longer able to have children because of her age. There is a natural period in a woman’s life when she stops being able to have children. The text assumes the reader understands that Sarah has already experienced this event. In English, this is called “menopause.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GEN	19	intro	hb2x			0		# Genesis 19 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The evil desires of the Sodomites<br>The men of Sodom desired to forcibly have sexual relations with the angels who came to the city appearing as men.

(See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]])<br><br>### Hospitality<br>Hospitality, or being kind to a visitor, was very important in the Ancient Near East. Lot showed his guests loyalty by doing his utmost to protect them from the people of Sodom.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Contrasts<br>It is probable that Abraham’s faith and actions in chapter 18 are intended to contrast with the actions of the worldly Sodomites.

This is because it would cause his son to worship other gods. Intermarriage and worshiping false gods are things that frequently caused Abraham’s descendants to struggle. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])<br><br>### Abraham’s wealth<br><br>There are many instances recorded in this chapter which highlight Abraham’s significant wealth. He owned more than 10 camels and had large amounts of gold.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “Put your hand under my thigh”<br><br>Many scholars believe this is a euphemism. Putting one’s hand on a man’s genitals was a way to make an important oath. It represented power and progeny. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

GEN	27	intro	r9m3			0		# Genesis 27 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 27:27-29 and in 27:39-40.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br>### Blessing<br>In the ancient Near East, a father’s blessing was very important. This spoken blessing was legally binding. Jacob previously received the birthright from Esau and was guaranteed the double portion of land money that was supposed to be inherited by the older son, Esau. In this chapter, Jacob tricks Isaac into giving him Esau’s blessing. This means that he is to inherit the promises of the covenant Yahweh made with Abraham.

If a woman did not have many children, people believed it brought shame upon her. This is one of the reasons why Rachel and Leah were always jealous of each other. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/jealous]])<br><br>### Speckled and spotted<br>Speckled and spotted sheep were considered to be imperfect. Therefore, they were considered to be much less valuable than the spotless sheep. Despite Jacob’s fair offer, Laban once again tried to cheat him out of something he deserved.

It is probable that Rachel believed these idols would bring them “good luck” and would bring them great blessing. This was sinful because they were to trust in Yahweh, who already promised to bless them.

The return of Jacob to Canaan was a significant event in the history of the Hebrew people.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “A man wrestled with him”<br>Scholars are divided over the identity of the person Jacob wrestled with.

GEN	37	intro	s17y			0		# Genesis 37 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter begins to record the account of Jacob’s sons. The rest of the book of Genesis focuses on Jacob’s sons, especially Joseph. This chapter also references Jacob as “Israel” beginning in this chapter.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Favoritism<br>Jacob’s favoritism became a great problem for his sons. They are always jealous of Joseph because he is the favorite son. The beautiful garment Jacob gave to Joseph greatly strained the relationship between Joseph and his brothers. Joseph dreams he will rule all of his brothers, even though he is not the oldest son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/favor]])<br><br>### God’s power<br>The account of Joseph focuses on the power of God. God is able to protect his people despite the evil actions of some. He also is able to continue to bless them despite their circumstances. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/bless]])
