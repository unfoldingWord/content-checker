REV	front	intro	xx8l			0		# Introduction to Revelation<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Revelation<br><br>1. Opening (1:1-20)<br>1. Letters to the seven churches (2:1-3:22)<br>1. Vision of God in heaven, and a vision of the Lamb (4:1-11)<br>1. The seven seals (6:1-8:1)<br>1. The seven trumpets (8:2-13:18)<br>1. Worshipers of the Lamb, the martyrs, and the harvest of wrath (14:1-20)<br>1. The seven bowls (15:1-18:24)<br>1. Worship in heaven (19:1-10)<br>1. The Lamb’s judgment, the destruction of the beast, the thousand years, the destruction of Satan, and the final judgment (20:11-15)<br>1. The new creation and the new Jerusalem (21:1-22:5)<br>1. Jesus’ promise to return, the witness from the angels, John’s closing words, Christ’s message to his church, the invitation and the warning (22:6-21)<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Revelation?<br><br>The author identified himself as John. This was probably the Apostle John. He wrote the Book of Revelation while on the island of Patmos. The Romans exiled John there for teaching people about Jesus.<br><br>### What is the Book of Revelation about?<br><br>John wrote the Book of Revelation to encourage believers to remain faithful even when they are suffering. John described visions he had of Satan and his followers fighting against and killing believers. In the visions God causes many terrible things to happen on the earth to punish wicked people. In the end, Jesus defeats Satan and his followers. Then Jesus comforts those who were faithful. And the believers will live forever with God in the new heavens and earth.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by one of its traditional titles, “Revelation,” “The Revelation of Jesus Christ,” “The Revelation to Saint John,” or “The Apocalypse of John.” Or they may choose a possibly clearer title, such as “The Things that Jesus Christ Showed to John.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### What type of writing is the Book of Revelation?<br><br>John used a special style of writing to describe his visions. John described what he saw by using many symbols. This style of writing is called symbolic prophecy or apocalyptic literature. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Are the events of Revelation past or future?<br><br>Since early Christian times, scholars have interpreted Revelation differently. Some scholars think John described events that happened during his time. Some scholars think John described events happening from his time until the return of Jesus. Other scholars think John described events that will happen in a short period of time just before Christ returns.<br><br>Translators will not need to decide how to interpret the book before they translate it. Translators should leave the prophecies in the tenses that are used in the ULT.<br><br>### Are there any other books in the Bible like Revelation?<br><br>No other book of the Bible is like the Book of Revelation. But, passages in Ezekiel, Zechariah, and especially Daniel are similar in content and style to Revelation. It may be beneficial to translate Revelation at the same time as Daniel since they have some imagery and style in common.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Does one need to understand the Book of Revelation to translate it?<br><br>One does not need to understand all of the symbols in the Book of Revelation to translate it properly. Translators should not give possible meanings for the symbols or numbers in their translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])<br><br>### How are the ideas of “holy” and “sanctify” represented in Revelation in the ULT?<br><br>The scriptures use these words to indicate any one of various ideas. For this reason, it is often difficult for translators to represent them well in their versions. In translating Revelation into English, the ULT uses the following principles:<br>* The meaning in two passages indicates moral holiness. Here, the ULT uses “holy.” (See: 14:12; 22:11)<br>* Usually the meaning in Revelation indicates a simple reference to Christians without implying any particular role filled by them. In these cases, the ULT uses “believer” or “believers.” (See: 5:8; 8:3, 4; 11:18; 13:7; 16:6; 17:6; 18:20, 24; 19:8; 20:9)<br>* Sometimes the meaning implies the idea of someone or something set apart for God alone. In these cases, the ULT uses “sanctify,” “set apart,” “dedicated to,” or “reserved for.”<br><br>The UST will often be helpful as translators think about how to represent these ideas in their own versions.<br><br>### Periods of time<br><br>John referred to various periods of time in Revelation. For example, there are many references to forty-two months, seven years, and three and a half days. Some scholars think these time periods are symbolic. Other scholars think these are actual time periods. The translator should treat these time periods as referencing actual periods of time. It is then up to the interpreter to determine their significance or what they may represent.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Revelation?<br><br>For the following verses, some modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* “‘I am the alpha and the omega,’ says the Lord God, ‘the one who is, and who was, and who is to come, the Almighty’” (1:8). Some versions add the phrase “the Beginning and the End.”<br>* “the elders prostrated themselves and worshiped” (5:14). Some older versions read, “the twenty-four elders prostrated themselves and worshiped the one who lives forever and ever.”<br>* “so that a third of it [the earth] was burned up” (8:7). Some older versions do not include this phrase.<br>* “the one who is and who was” (11:17). Some versions add the phrase “and who is to come.”<br>* “they are blameless” (14:5). Some versions add the phrase “before the throne of God” (14:5).<br>* “the one who is and who was, the Holy One” (16:5). Some older versions read, “O Lord, the One who is and who was and who is to be.”<br>* “The nations will walk by the light of that city” (21:24). Some older versions read, “The nations that are saved will walk by the light of that city.”<br>* “Blessed are those who wash their robes” (22:14). Some older versions read “Blessed are those who do his commandments.”<br>* “God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city” (22:19). Some older versions read, “God will take away his share in the book of life and in the holy city.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
REV	1	intro	u1e2			0		# Revelation 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>This chapter explains how the Book of Revelation records the vision John received on the island of Patmos.<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page to make them easier to read. The ULT does this with the quoted words in verse 7.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Seven churches<br><br>John wrote this book to seven actual churches in Asia Minor, which is now the country of Turkey.<br><br>### White<br><br>The Bible often speaks of something that belongs to a person as being “white.” This is metaphor and metonym for that person living rightly and pleasing God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])<br><br>### “Him who is, and who was, and who is to come”<br><br>God exists now. He has always existed. He will always exist. Your language may have a different way of saying this.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Blood<br><br>Blood is a metonym for death. Jesus “has released us from our sins by his blood.” John means that Jesus saved us from our sins by dying for us. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “He is coming with the clouds”<br><br>Jesus went into the clouds when he went up to heaven after God raised him from the dead. When Jesus returns, he will also be “with the clouds.” It is not clear whether he will be sitting or riding on clouds or coming in the clouds or “with the clouds” in some other way. Your translation should express this in a way that is natural in your language.<br><br>### “One like a son of man”<br><br>This refers to Jesus. You should translate the words “son of man” using the same words as you did in the Gospels for when Jesus called himself the “Son of Man.”<br><br>### “The angels of the seven churches”<br><br>The word “angels” here can also mean “messengers.” This might refer to heavenly beings, or to the messengers or leaders of these seven churches. John uses the same word “angel” (singular) in verse 1 and in many other places throughout the book. Your translation should also use the same word.

REV	2	intro	zps2			0		# Revelation 02 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Chapters 2 and 3 together are usually called the “seven letters to the seven churches.” You may wish to set each letter apart. The reader can then easily see that they are separate letters.<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted words of verse 27.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Poverty and wealth<br><br>The Christians in Smyrna were poor because they did not have much money. But they were rich spiritually because God would reward them for their suffering. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/spirit]])<br><br>### “The devil is about to”<br><br>People were about to take some of the Christians in Smyrna and throw them into prison and even kill some of them ([Revelation 2:10](../../rev/02/10.md)). John does not say who these people were. But he does speak of them harming the Christians as if Satan himself were harming them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])<br><br>### Balaam, Balak, and Jezebel<br><br>Balaam, Balak, and Jezebel were people who lived long before Jesus was born.

See how you translated “angel” in [Revelation 1:20](../../rev/01/20.md).<br><br>### “The words of the one who”<br><br>The verses with these words can be difficult to translate. They do not make complete sentences. You may need to add “These are” to the beginning of these verses. Also, Jesus used these words to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another person. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking of other people. Jesus began speaking in [Revelation 1:17](../../rev/01/17.md). He continues to speak through the end of Chapter 3.

REV	3	intro	q1l9			0		# Revelation 03 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Chapters 2 and 3 together are usually called the “seven letters to the seven churches.” You may wish to set each letter apart. The reader can then easily see that they are separate letters.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verse 7.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Seven spirits of God<br><br>These spirits are the seven spirits of [Revelation 1:4](../../rev/01/04.md).<br><br>### Seven stars<br><br>These stars are the seven stars of [Revelation 1:20](../../rev/01/20.md).<br><br>## Important metaphors in this chapter<br><br>### Look, I am standing at the door and am knocking<br><br>Jesus speaks of his desire to have the Christians in Laodicea obey him as if he were a man asking people in a house to allow him to enter and eat with them ([Revelation 3:20](../../rev/03/20.md)). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>### “Let the one who has an ear, hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches”<br><br>The speaker knew that almost all of his readers had physical ears.

They do not make complete sentences. You may need to add “These are” to the beginning of these verses. Also, Jesus used these words to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another person. Your language may not allow people to speak of themselves as if they were speaking of other people. Jesus began speaking in [Revelation 1:17](../../rev/01/17.md).

REV	4	intro	cl9f			0		# Revelation 04 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with verses 8 and 11.<br><br>John has finished describing the letters to the churches. He now begins to describe a vision that God showed him.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Jasper, carnelian, and emerald<br><br>These words refer to kinds of special stones that the people in John’s day considered valuable. It may be difficult for you to translate these words if people in your culture do not value special kinds of stones.<br><br>### Twenty-four elders<br><br>Elders are church leaders. Twenty-four elders may be symbolic of the whole church through the ages. There were twelve tribes in Old Testament Israel and twelve apostles in the New Testament church. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])<br><br>### Seven spirits of God<br><br>These spirits are the seven spirits of [Revelation 1:4](../../rev/01/04.md).<br><br>### Giving glory to God<br><br>God’s glory is the great beauty and radiant majesty that God has because he is God. Other Bible writers describe it as if it were a light so bright that no one can look at it. No one can give God this kind of glory, because it is already his. When people give glory to God or when God receives glory, people say that God has the glory that is his, that it is right for God to have that glory, and that people should worship God because he has that glory.

REV	5	intro	g7ey			0		# Revelation 05 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this in verses 9-13.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sealed scroll<br><br>Kings and important people in John’s time wrote important documents on large pieces of paper or animal skin. They then rolled them up and sealed them with wax so they would stay closed. Only the person to whom the document was written had the authority to open it by breaking the seal. In this chapter, “the one who was seated on the throne” had written the scroll. Only the person called “the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David” and “the Lamb” had the authority to open it. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/other/scroll]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/authority]])<br><br>### Twenty-four elders<br><br>Elders are church leaders.

Jesus descended from the tribe of Judah and the family of David. Lions are fierce, and all animals and people are afraid of them, so they are a metaphor for a king whom everyone obeys. The words “Root of David” speak of Israel’s King David as if he were a seed that God had planted and of Jesus as if he were a root growing from that seed.

REV	9	intro	sq5c			0		# Revelation 09 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>In this chapter, John continues to describe what happens when angels sound seven trumpets. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-apocalypticwriting]])<br><br>### Woe<br>John describes several “woes” in the Book of Revelation. This chapter begins to describe three “woes” announced at the end of Chapter 8.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Animal imagery<br>This chapter includes several animals: locusts, scorpions, horses, lions, and snakes. Animals convey different qualities or traits. For example, a lion is powerful and dangerous. Translators should use the same animals in their translation if possible. If the animal is unknown, one with similar qualities or traits should be used.<br><br>### Bottomless pit<br>This image is seen several times in the Book of Revelation. It is a picture of hell as being inescapable and the opposite direction as heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/hell]])<br><br>### Abaddon and Apollyon<br><br>“Abaddon” is a Hebrew word. “Apollyon” is a Greek word. Both words mean “Destroyer.” John used the sounds of the Hebrew word and wrote them with Greek letters. The ULT and UST write the sounds of both words with English letters. Translators are encouraged to transliterate these words using the letters of the target language. The original Greek readers would have understood “Apollyon” to mean “Destroyer.” So translators may also supply what it means in the text or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])<br><br>### Repentance<br>Despite great signs, people are described as not repenting and so remain in their sin. People refusing to repent are also mentioned in Chapter 16. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/repent]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Simile<br>John uses many similes in this chapter. They help to describe the images that he sees in his vision. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

The curse that began in Eden will end at this time.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Alpha and omega<br><br>These are the names of the first and last letters in the Greek alphabet. The ULT spells out their names in English. This strategy can serve as a model for translators. Some translators, however, may decide to use the first and last letters in their own alphabet.
