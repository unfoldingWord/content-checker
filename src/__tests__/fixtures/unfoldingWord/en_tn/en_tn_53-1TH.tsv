1TH	front	intro	jp2y			0		# Introduction to 1 Thessalonians<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of 1 Thessalonians<br><br>1. Greeting (1:1)<br>1. Prayer of thanksgiving for the Thessalonian Christians (1:2-10)<br>1. Paul’s ministry in Thessalonica (2:1-16)<br>1. Paul’s concerns for their spiritual growth<br>- Like a mother (2:7)<br>- Like a father (2:11)<br>1. Paul sends Timothy to the Thessalonians and Timothy reports back to Paul (3:1-13)<br>1. Practical instructions<br>- Live to please God (4:1-12)<br>- Comfort regarding those who have died (4:12-18)<br>- Christ’s return is a motive for godly living (5:1-11)<br>1. Closing blessings, thanks, and prayers (5:12-28)<br><br>### Who wrote 1 Thessalonians?<br><br>Paul wrote 1 Thessalonians. Paul was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>Paul wrote this letter while staying in the city of Corinth. Of all Paul’s letters that are in the Bible, many scholars think 1 Thessalonians was the first letter Paul wrote.<br><br>### What is the Book of 1 Thessalonians about?<br><br>Paul wrote this letter to the believers in the city of Thessalonica. He wrote it after the Jews in the city forced him to leave. In this letter he said he considered his visit to them a success, even though he was forced to leave.<br><br>Paul responded to the news from Timothy about the Thessalonian believers. The believers there were being persecuted. He encouraged them to continue living in a way that pleased God. He also comforted them by explaining what happens to those who die before Christ returns.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “1 Thessalonians” or “First Thessalonians.” They may instead prefer to choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica,” or “The First Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the “second coming” of Jesus?<br><br>Paul wrote much in this letter about Jesus’ eventual return to Earth. When Jesus returns, he will judge all mankind. He will also rule over creation, and there will be peace everywhere.<br><br>### What happens to those who die before the return of Christ?<br><br>Paul made clear that those who die before Christ’s return will come back to life and be with Jesus. They will not remain dead forever. Paul wrote this to encourage the Thessalonians. For some of them worried that those who died would miss the great day when Jesus returns.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What did Paul mean by expressions like “in Christ” and “in the Lord.”?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very a close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Thessalonians?<br><br>For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* “May grace and peace be to you” (1:1). Some older versions read: “Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”<br>* “Instead, we were as gentle among you as a mother comforting her own children.” (2:7) Other modern versions and older versions read, “Instead, we were like babies among you, as when a mother comforts her own children.”<br>* “Timothy, our brother and fellow worker for God” (3:2). Some other versions read: “Timothy, our brother and servant of God.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
