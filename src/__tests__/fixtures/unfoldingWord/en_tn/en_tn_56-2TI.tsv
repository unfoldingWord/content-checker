2TI	front	intro	s7fk			0		# Introduction to 2 Timothy<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of 2 Timothy<br><br>1. Paul greets Timothy and encourages him to endure hardship as he serves God (1:1-2:13).<br>1. Paul gives general instructions to Timothy (2:14–26).<br>1. Paul warns Timothy about future events and instructs him about how to carry out his service to God (3:1-4:8).<br>1. Paul makes personal remarks (4:9-24).<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of 2 Timothy?<br><br>Paul wrote 2 Timothy. He was from the city of Tarsus. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee. He persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire telling people about Jesus.<br><br>This book is the second letter Paul wrote Timothy. Timothy was his disciple and close friend. Paul wrote this letter while in prison in Rome. Paul would die soon after writing this letter.<br><br>### What is the Book of 2 Timothy about?<br><br>Paul had left Timothy in the city of Ephesus to help the believers there. Paul wrote this letter to instruct Timothy about various matter. The topics he addressed include warnings about false teachers and enduring difficult situations. This letter also shows how Paul was training Timothy to be a leader among the churches.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or “Second Timothy.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy” or “The Second Letter to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the soldier imagery in 2 Timothy?<br><br>As Paul waited in prison, knowing he would die soon, he often spoke of himself as a soldier of Jesus Christ. Soldiers answer to their leaders. In the same way, Christians answer to Jesus. As “soldiers” of Christ, believers are to obey his commands, even if they die as a result.<br><br>### What does it mean that God inspired Scripture?<br><br>God is the true author of Scripture. He inspired the human authors who wrote the books. That means God in some way caused the people to write what they wrote. This is why it is also referred to as God’s word. This implies several things about the Bible. First, the Bible is free from error and can be trusted. Second, we can rely on God to protect the scripture from those who want to distort it or destroy it. Third, God’s word should be translated into all the world’s languages.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br><br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Paul. Here the word “you” is almost always singular and refers to Timothy. The exception to this is 4:22. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?<br><br>Paul meant to express the idea of a very close union with Christ and the believers. Please see the introduction to the Book of Romans for more details about this kind of expression.<br><br>### What are the major textual issues in the text of the Book of 2 Timothy?<br><br>For the following verses, modern versions of the Bible differ from older versions. The ULT text has the modern reading and puts the older reading in a footnote. If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>* “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher” (1:11). Some older versions read, “Because of this, I was appointed a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher to the Gentiles.”<br>* “Warn them before God” (2:14). Some older versions read, “Warn them before the Lord.”<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Spiritual children<br><br>Paul discipled Timothy as a Christian and a church leader.
