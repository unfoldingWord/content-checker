1PE	front	intro	c1uv			0		# Introduction to 1 Peter<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of 1 Peter<br><br>1. Introduction (1:1-2)<br>1. Praise for God’s salvation of the believers (1:3-2:10)<br>1. Christian living (2:11-4:11)<br>1. Encouragement to persevere when suffering (4:12-5:11)<br>1. Closing (5:12-14)<br><br><br>### Who wrote the Book of 1 Peter?<br><br>The Book of 1 Peter was written by the Apostle Peter. He wrote the letter to Gentile Christians scattered throughout Asia Minor.<br><br>### What is the Book of 1 Peter about?<br><br>Peter stated that he wrote this letter for the purpose of “encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God” (5:12).<br>He encouraged Christians to continue obeying God even when they are suffering. He told them to do this because Jesus will return soon. Peter also gave instructions about Christians submitting to persons in authority.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title “1 Peter” or “First Peter.” Or they may choose a clearer title, such as “The First Letter from Peter” or “The First Letter Peter Wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### How were Christians treated in Rome?<br><br>Peter probably was in Rome when he wrote this letter. He gave Rome the symbolic name of “Babylon” (5:13). It appears that when Peter wrote this letter, Romans were badly persecuting Christians.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### Singular and plural “you”<br>In this book, the word “I” refers to Peter, except for two places: [1 Peter 1:16](../01/16.md) and [1 Peter 2:6](../02/06.md). The word “you” is always plural and refers to Peter’s audience. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-you]])<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of 1 Peter?<br><br>* “You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth. This was for the purpose of sincere brotherly love; so love one another earnestly from the heart” (1:22). The ULT, UST, and most other modern versions read this way. Some older versions read, “You made your souls pure by obedience to the truth through the Spirit for the purpose of sincere brotherly love, so love one another earnestly from the heart.”<br><br>If a translation of the Bible exists in the general region, translators should consider using the reading found in those versions. If not, translators are advised to follow the modern reading.<br><br>(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
1PE	1	intro	ql4i			0		# 1 Peter 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Peter formally introduces this letter in verses 1-2. Writers often began letters in this way in the ancient Near East.<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry that is quoted from the Old Testament in 1:24-25.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### What God reveals<br><br>When Jesus comes again, everyone will see how good God’s people were to have faith in Jesus. Then God’s people will see how gracious God has been to them, and all people will praise both God and his people.<br><br>### Holiness<br><br>God wants his people to be holy because God is holy. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holy]])<br><br>### Eternity<br><br>Peter tells Christians to live for things that will last forever and not to live for the things of this world, which will end. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/eternity]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Peter writes that his readers are glad and sad at the same time ([1 Peter 1:6](./06.md)). He can say this because they are sad because they are suffering, but they are glad because they know that God will save them “in the last time” ([1 Peter 1:5](./05.md))
