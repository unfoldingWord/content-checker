# What will Yahweh tell these wicked and rebellious ones when they cry out?

Yahweh will tell them to let their collection of idols deliver them.

# What will happen to these wicked and rebellious ones?

The wind will carry them all away, a breath will carry them all away.

# What will happen to the ones who take refuge in Yahweh?

They will inherit the land and take possession of Yahwehâ€™s holy mountain.
