# What is the everlasting sign that will not be cut off?

This is the sign: Israel will go out in joy and be led along peacefully. the mountains and the hills will break out in joyful shouts before them. All the trees of the fields will clap their hands. Instead of the thorn bushes, evergreens will grow and instead of the brier, the myrtle tree will grow.
