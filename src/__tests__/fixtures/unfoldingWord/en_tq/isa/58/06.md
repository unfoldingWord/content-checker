# What is the fast that Yahweh chooses?

The fast that Yahweh chooses is to release wicked bonds, to undo the ropes of the yoke, to set the crushed ones free, to break every yoke, to break their bread with the hungry, to bring the poor and homeless into their houses, to clothe the naked and to not hide themselves from their own relatives.
