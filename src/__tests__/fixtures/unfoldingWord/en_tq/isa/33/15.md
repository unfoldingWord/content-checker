# Who among those in Zion can dwell with the devouring fire and the everlasting burnings?

The ones who can dwell with this fire and burning are the ones who walk righteously and speak honestly; who despise the gain of oppression, who refuse to take a bribe, who do not plot violent crime and do not look on evil.

# Where will he who walks righteously and speaks honestly make his home ?

He who walks righteously and speaks honestly will make his home on the heights.
