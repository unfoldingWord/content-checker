# Why must the nations, the earth and all that fills it, the world and all things that come from it come near, listen and pay attention?

They must do this because Yahweh is angry with all the nations and furious against all their armies.

# What has Yahweh done to the nations and their armies?

He has completely destroyed them. He has delivered them to the slaughter.
