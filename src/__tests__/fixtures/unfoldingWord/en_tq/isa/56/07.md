# What will Yahweh do for foreigners who join themselves to Yahweh to serve him, who worship him and love his name, who observe the sabbath and keeps from defiling it, and who hold fast Yahweh’s covenant?

Yahweh will bring them to his holy mountain and make them joyful in his house of prayer; their burnt offerings and sacrifices will be accepted on Yahweh’s altar.
