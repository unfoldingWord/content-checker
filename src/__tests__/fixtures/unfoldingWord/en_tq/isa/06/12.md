# How long was Isaiah supposed to tell the Lord’s message to the people?

Isaiah was to tell the people the Lord’s message until the cities were in ruins without inhabitants and the houses were without people and the land fell into a desolate waste, and until Yahweh sent the people far away and the solitude of the land was great.
