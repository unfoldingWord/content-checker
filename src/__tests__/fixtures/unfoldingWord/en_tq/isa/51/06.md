# What will happen to the heavens, the earth and its inhabitants?

The heavens will vanish away like smoke, the earth will wear out like a garment; and its inhabitants will die like flies.

# What will continue forever and never stop working?

Yahwehâ€™s righteousness will continue forever and his righteousness will never stop working.
