# What is too small a thing for Yahweh’s servant?

It is too small a thing to be Yahweh’s servant to reestablish the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the survivors of Israel.

# What further will Yahweh do for his servant?

He will make his servant a light to the gentiles that his servant may be Yahweh’s salvation to the ends of the earth.
