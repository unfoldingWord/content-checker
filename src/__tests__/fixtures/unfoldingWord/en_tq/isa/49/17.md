# What does Yahweh offer as proof of his concern for Zion?

Yahweh states his proof as follows: â€œLook , I have inscribed your name on my palms; your walls are continually before me. Your children are hurrying back, while those who destroyed you are departing. Look around and see, they are all gathering and coming to you.
