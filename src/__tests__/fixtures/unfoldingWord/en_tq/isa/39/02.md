# What did Hezekiah show to those who brought the letters and present from Merodach-baladan?

Hezekiah showed them his treasuryâ€”the silver, the gold, the spices, the precious oil, the storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his storehouses. Hezekiah showed them everything in his house and kingdom.
