# What message did Isaiah give to Hezekiah’s servants to take back to Hezekiah?

Isaiah’s message to Hezekiah was to not fear the words of the king of Assyria’s servant, the Rabshakeh. Yahweh was going to put a spirit in The king of Assyria, and he would hear a report and go back to his own land and would be killed by the sword there.
