# What will no longer be said of Zion and her land?

Zion will no longer be called “Abandoned” and her land will no longer be called “Desolate”.

# Why will Zion be called “My delight is in her” and Zion’s land “Married”?

She will be called those things because Yahweh delights in her and her land will be married.
