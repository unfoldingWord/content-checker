# What did the king of Assyria say would happen if the Jews would make peace with him and come out to him?

He said the Jews would eat from their own vine and from their own fig tree, and drink water from their own cistern, until he would come and take the Jews away to a land like their own land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.
