# What did Yahweh tell Isaiah to say to Hezekiah?

He said to tell Hezekiah that he had heard Hezekiah’s prayer and his tears. Yahweh told Hezekiah he would add fifteen years to Hezekiah’s life and in addition he would rescue Hezekiah and Jerusalem from the king of Assyria and would defend Jerusalem.
