# unfoldingWord® Translation Questions

This is the repository for the [unfoldingWord® Translation Questions (UTQ)](https://www.unfoldingword.org/utq/) resource.


## Description

unfoldingWord® Translation Questions are comprehension and theological questions for each chapter of the Bible. It enables translators and translation checkers to confirm that the intended meaning of their translations is clearly communicated to the speakers of that language.
