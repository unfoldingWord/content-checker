# What did the king find when he spoke with the whole group of young men?

The king found that there were none to compare with Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah. In every question of wisdom and knowledge that the king asked them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and those who claimed to speak with the dead, who were in his entire kingdom.
