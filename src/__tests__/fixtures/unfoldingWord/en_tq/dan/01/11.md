# What did Daniel ask of the steward who had been assigned over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael and Azariah?

Daniel asked the steward to test them for ten days by giving them only vegetables to eat and water to drink and at the end of ten days to compare them with the other young men who ate the kingâ€™s delicacies and then to treat them based of what he saw.
