# What will this intelligent, grim-face king do?

He will cause widespread destruction and succeed in whatever he does. He will destroy powerful people, people who are holy. He will make deceit prosper under his hand. He will rise up against the king of kings.

# What will finally happen to the intelligent, grim-faced king?

He will be broken, but not by human power.
