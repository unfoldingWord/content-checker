# What was the response of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego to the king when the king repeated the command to fall down and worship the statue, and stated the consequences if they didn’t follow the king’s command?

Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego responded that their God could and would keep them safe and rescue them from the blazing furnace. But even if not, they would not worship Nebuchadnezzar’s gods or prostrate themselves to the statue.
