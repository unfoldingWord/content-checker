# What decree did Nebuchadnezzar issue after the event of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego and the blazing furnace?

Nebuchadnezzar decreed that any people, nation or language that spoke anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego would be torn apart, their houses would be made into hills of sewage because there was no other god who was able to save like that.
