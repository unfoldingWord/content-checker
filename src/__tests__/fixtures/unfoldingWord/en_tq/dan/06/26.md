# What did Darius say concerning God in his decree about the God of Daniel?

Darius said of the God of Daniel “…he is the living God and lives forever, and his kingdom shall not be destroyed; his dominion shall be to the end. He makes us safe and rescues us, and he does signs and wonders in heaven and in earth; he has kept Daniel safe from the power of the lions.
