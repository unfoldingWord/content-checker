# What were the ways that Paul and his companions had renounced?

They had renounced the ways that are shameful and hidden. They didn’t live by craftiness and did not mishandle the word of God.

# How did Paul and those like him recommend themselves to everyone’s conscience in the sight of God?

They did this by presenting the truth.
