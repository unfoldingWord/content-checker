# Does Paul want this task to be done so others may be relieved and the Corinthian saints may be burdened?

No. Paul said the Corinthian’s abundance at that current time would supply what they (the other saints) needed. Also so that their abundance might also supply the Corinthian saint’s need, and so that there might be fairness.
