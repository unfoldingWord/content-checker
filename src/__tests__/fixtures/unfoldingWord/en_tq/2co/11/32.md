# What were some of the specific dangers Paul endured?

Paul received five times the “forty lashes minus one” from the Jews. Three times he was beaten with rods. Once he was stoned. Three times he was shipwrecked. He spent a night and a day in the open sea. He was in danger from rivers, from robbers, from his own people, from the Gentiles. He was in danger in the city, in the wilderness, in the sea and in danger from false brothers. Paul was also in danger from the governor of Damascus.
