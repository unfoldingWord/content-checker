# Why did Paul think it necessary to urge the brothers to go to the Corinthian saints and make arrangements in advance for the gift the Corinthians had promised?

Paul thought is necessary so that Paul and his companions would not be put to shame in case any Macedonians came with Paul and found the Corinthians unprepared. Paul wanted the Corinthians to be ready with the gift as one freely offered and not because the Corinthians were forced to give it.
