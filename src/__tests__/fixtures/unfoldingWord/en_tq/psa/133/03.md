# What does David say the unity of brothers is like?

It is like the precious oil that flowed down the head, beard, and garments of Aaron. It is also like the dew of Hermon, which comes down upon the mountains of Zion.

# Where did Yahweh decree the blessing of life forevermore?

He decreed life forevermore upon the mountains of Zion.
