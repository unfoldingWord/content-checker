# What are some of the characteristics of love?

Love is patient and kind; it does not envy or boast; it isn’t arrogant or rude. It is not self serving, not easily angered, nor does it keep a count of wrongs. It doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness but rejoices with the truth. It bears all things, believes all things, has confidence concerning all things, and endures all things.
