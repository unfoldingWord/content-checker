# Why should the people of Israel not listen to the words of a prophet or dreamer of dreams who gives a sign or a wonder and says “Let us go after other gods, that you have not known and let us worship them.”

The people of Israel should not listen because Yahweh is testing the them to know whether they love him with all their heart and with all their soul.
