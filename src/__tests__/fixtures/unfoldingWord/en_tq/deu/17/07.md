# Who must throw the first stones when putting a person to death?

The hand of the witnesses must be the first to throw the stones, followed by the rest of the people of Israel.

# Why must the Israelites stone the person to death who has done this wicked thing of worshiping other gods?

This will remove the evil from among them.
