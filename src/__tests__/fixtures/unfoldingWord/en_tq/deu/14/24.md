# What are the Israelites allowed to do with the tithe if the place that Yahweh will choose as his sanctuary is too far away?

They can convert the offering into money, tie up the money in their hand, and go to the place that Yahweh has chosen if the journey is too long for them so that they can not carry the tithe.
