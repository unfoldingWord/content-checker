# How generous were the instructions from Yahweh about what the Israelites could eat from their neighbor’s vineyard and fields?

They could eat their fill of grapes from their neighbor’s vineyard as long as they did not put any in containers and they could pluck the ears of grain from their neighbor’s field as long as they did not use a sickle.
