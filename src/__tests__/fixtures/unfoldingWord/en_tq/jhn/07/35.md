# Did the Jews understand what Jesus meant when he said, “Yet a little while am I still with you, and then I go to him who sent me. You will seek me but will not find me; where I go, you will not be able to come.”?

By their conversation among themselves they indicated that they did not understand Jesus’ statement.
