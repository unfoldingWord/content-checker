# In brief what does Jesus ask the Father to do for those the Father has given to Jesus?

Jesus asks the Father to keep them in the Fatherâ€™s name so they may be one, to keep them from the evil one, to consecrate them in the truth, for them to be in both Jesus and the Father and to have those the Father has given him to be with him where he is.
