# What is in the Father’s house?

There are many dwelling places in the Father’s house.

# Why should the hearts of the disciples not be troubled?

Their hearts should not be troubled because Jesus is going to prepare a place for them and Jesus will come again to receive them to himself so that where Jesus is they may be also.
