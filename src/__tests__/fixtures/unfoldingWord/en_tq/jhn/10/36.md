# What is Jesus’ defense against the charge of blasphemy?

Jesus defends himself by saying, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods’”? If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken), do you say about him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?.
