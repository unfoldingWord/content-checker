# What does Jesus tell the woman about the water that he will give?

Jesus tells the woman those who drink the water he gives will never thirst again and that water will become a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.

# Why does the woman now want this water that Jesus offers?

She wants the water so she wonâ€™t get thirsty and not have to come to the well to draw water.
