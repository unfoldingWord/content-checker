# Why did the Jews say Jesus had a demon?

They said this because Jesus said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death.

# Why did the Jews think Jesus’ statement about never seeing death was outlandish?

They thought this because they were thinking of the physical death of the body. Even Abraham and the prophets died (their physical bodies).
