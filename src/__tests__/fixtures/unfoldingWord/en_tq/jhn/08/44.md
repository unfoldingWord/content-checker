# Who does Jesus say is the father of these Jews?

Jesus says their father is the devil.

# What did Jesus say about the devil?

Jesus said the devil was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth because there is no truth in him. When the devil speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature because he is a liar and the father of lies.
