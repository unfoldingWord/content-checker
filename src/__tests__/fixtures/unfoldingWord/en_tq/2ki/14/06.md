# Why did Amaziah not put the sons of the assassins to death?

Amaziah did not put the sons of the assassins to death because Yahweh had commanded him, saying, “The fathers must not be put to death for their children, neither must the children be put to death for their parents. Instead, every person must be put to death for his own sin.”
