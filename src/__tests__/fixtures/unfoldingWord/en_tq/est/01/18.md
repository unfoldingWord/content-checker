# What did Memucan say the noble women of Persia and Media would do before the end of that very day?

For the matter of the queen will go out to all the women, in order to make their husbands despised in their eyes when they say, ‘The king Ahasuerus said to bring Vashti the queen before him, but she did not come.’ Now this day, the noblewomen of Persia and Media who have heard the matter of the queen will speak to all the officials of the king; and there will be contempt and wrath enough!
