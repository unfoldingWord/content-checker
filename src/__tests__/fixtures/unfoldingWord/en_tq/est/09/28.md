# Why would the Jews and their descendants never cease to faithfully observe these days of Purim?

So these days are remembered and are made in every generation by generation, family by family, province by province, and city by city. And these days of Purim will not pass away from the midst of the Jews, and their remembrance will not come to an end from their seed.
