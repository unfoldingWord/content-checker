# When Ruth stayed with Naomi, what promise did Ruth make to Naomi?

She said, “For I will go to the place where you go, and I will stay in the place where you stay. Your people are my people, and your God is my God. In the place where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May Yahweh do thus to me, and thus may he add, if death separates between me and between you.”
