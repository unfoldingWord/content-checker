# In the parable of the weeds, who sows the good seed, what is the field, who is the good seed, who are the weeds, and who sowed the weeds?

The sower of the good seed is the Son of Man, the field is the world, the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, the weeds are the sons of the evil one, and the sower of the weeds is the devil.
