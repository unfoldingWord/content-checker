# What two questions did Yahweh ask the people of the land and the priests through Zechariah concerning fasting, eating and drinking?

The first question Yahweh asked was, “When you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh month for these seventy years, were you truly fasting for me?” The second question was, “And when you ate and drank, did you not eat and drink for yourselves?”
