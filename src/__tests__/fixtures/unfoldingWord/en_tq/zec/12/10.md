# On that day, what will Yahweh pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem?

Yahweh will pour out a spirit of compassion and supplication.

# What will the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem do when they look upon him whom they have pierced?

When they look on him whom they have pierced, they will lament and mourn for him as one mourns and laments for an only son or over the death of a firstborn son.
