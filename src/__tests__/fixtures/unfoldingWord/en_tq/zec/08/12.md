# How did Yahweh say it would be during Zechariahâ€™s time?

Yahweh said it would not be as in former days. He said seeds of peace would be sown. The climbing vine would give its fruit, and the earth would give its produce. The skies would give their dew. Yahweh would make the remnant of that people inherit all those things.
