# How does Yahweh command the people to behave and why?

Yahweh said the people must all speak truth with his neighbor, and judge with truth, justice, and peace in their gates. He said let no one plot evil in their heart against their neighbor nor be attracted to false oaths. Yahweh commanded these things because they were things he hates.
