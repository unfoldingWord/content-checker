# Yahweh said he would raise up a shepherd in the land. What will that shepherd do?

That shepherd will not care for the sheep. He will not seek the sheep who have gone astray, nor heal the crippled sheep. He will not feed the steadfast sheep, but will eat the fattened sheep and tear off their hooves.
