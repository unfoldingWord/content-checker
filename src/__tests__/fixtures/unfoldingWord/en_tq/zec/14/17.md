# What will happen if anyone from all the nations of the earth does not go up to Jerusalem to worship the king, Yahweh of hosts?

If anyone does not go up to Jerusalem, Yahweh will not bring rain on them. A plague from Yahweh will attack the nations that do not go up to keep the Festival of Shelters.
