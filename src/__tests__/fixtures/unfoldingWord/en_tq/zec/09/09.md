# Why is the daughter of Zion told to shout with great joy and the daughter of Jerusalem told to shout with happiness?

They are told to do this because their king is coming to them with righteousness and is going to rescue them.

# How will their king come to them?

Their king will be humble and will ride on a donkey, on the colt of a donkey.
