# What did Yahweh of hosts say concerning Jerusalem and the cities of Judah?

Yahweh said he had returned to Jerusalem with mercies, that his house would be built within her and the measuring line would be stretched out over Jerusalem. Yahweh also said his cities would once again overflow with goodness and Yahweh would again comfort Zion and once again choose Jerusalem.
