# What must a man do with a field he has sanctified to Yahweh in the year of the jubilee?

When a man has sanctified a field to Yahweh and the year of the jubilee comes, the priest will figure the estimated value of the field up to the year of the jubilee and the man must pay its value on that day as a holy gift to Yahweh.
