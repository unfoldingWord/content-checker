# Who are the people Yahweh says are like the bad figs?

Zedekiah, the people who remain in the land, and the people who go to Egypt are like the bad figs.

# What will Yahweh do to the people he says are like the bad figs?

He will make things go badly for them, and he will kill them by war, famine, and sickness.
