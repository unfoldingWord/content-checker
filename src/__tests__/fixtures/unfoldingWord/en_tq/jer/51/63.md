# What were Jeremiahâ€™s instructions to Seraiah?

Jeremiah told Seraiah that when he arrived in Babylon he was to read all the words on the scroll, tie a stone to it, and throw it into the Euphrates River.

# Why was Seraiah to throw the scroll in the river?

When he threw the scroll in the river, the people would understand that Babylon will sink like the scroll because of the disaster Yahweh is sending on her.
