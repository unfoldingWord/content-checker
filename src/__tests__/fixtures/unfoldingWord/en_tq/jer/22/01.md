# What does Yahweh tell the King of Judah, his servants, and his people to do?

They are to listen to the word of Yahweh, act justly, help those who have been robbed, and rescue the oppressed. They are not to mistreat foreigners, orphans, or widows, and they are not to be violent or kill innocent people.
