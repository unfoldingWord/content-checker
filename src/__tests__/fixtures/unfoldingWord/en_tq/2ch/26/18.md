# Why did Azariah and the eighty priests go in after Uzziah, and why did Azariah say that Uzziah had trespassed when he burned incense in the sanctuary?

The priests told Uzziah that it is only the priests, the sons of Aaron, who are consecrated to burn incense in the sanctuary, so Uzziah had trespassed when he burned incense to Yahweh.
