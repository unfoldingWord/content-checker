# Why did the Levites leave their pasture lands and property in order to come to Judah and Jerusalem?

The Levites left their pastureland and property because Jeroboam and his sons had driven them away, so that they could no longer perform priestly duties for Yahweh.

# How did Jeroboam replace the priests and Levites who moved to Judah?

Jeroboam appointed for himself priests for the shrines and the idols of calves and goats that he had made.
