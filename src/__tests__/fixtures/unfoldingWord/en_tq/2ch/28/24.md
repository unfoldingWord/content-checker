# What did Ahaz do to the furnishings of the house of God?

Ahaz cut the furnishings to pieces and shut the doors of the house of Yahweh.

# What was the result of Ahaz making altars for himself in every corner of Jerusalem, and making shrines to burn sacrifices to other gods in every city of Judah?

The result of Ahazâ€™s actions was that he provoked to anger Yahweh, the God of his ancestors.
