# Why did Hezekiah pray for the people of Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, and for what did he pray?

Many of the people had not purified themselves and ate the Passover meal against the written instructions. So Hezekiah prayed for Yahweh to pardon those who set their hearts to seek God, although they were not purified by the standards of the sanctuary.
