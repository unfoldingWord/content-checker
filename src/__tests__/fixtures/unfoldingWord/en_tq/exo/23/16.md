# When were the Festival of Harvest and the Festival of Ingathering to be observed?

You must observe the Festival of Harvest, with the first fruits of your labors when you sowed seed in the fields. Also you must observe the Festival of Ingathering at the end of the year, when you gather in your produce from the fields.
