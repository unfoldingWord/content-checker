# What would happen if the Israelites mistreat any widow or fatherless child?

If the Israelites mistreats them at all, and if they cry out to Yahweh, he will surely hear their cry. His anger will burn, and he will kill them with the sword; their wives will become widows, and their children will become fatherless.
