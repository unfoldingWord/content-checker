# If a man gives money or goods to his neighbor for safe keeping, and if it is stolen out of the man’s house, but the thief is not found, what will happen?

If a man gives money or goods to his neighbor for safe keeping, and if it is stolen out of the man’s house, if the thief is found, that thief must pay double. But if the thief is not found, then the owner of the house must come before the judges to see whether he has put his own hand on his neighbor’s property.
