# On the day that was coming, burning like a furnace, what would happen to the proud and evildoers?

The proud and evildoers would become stubble, being burnt up.

# For whom would the sun of righteousness rise?

The sun of righteousness would rise for those who feared Yahweh’s name.

# What would those who feared Yahweh’s name do on the day that Yahweh acted?

They would go out leaping like calves from the stall and tread down the wicked.
