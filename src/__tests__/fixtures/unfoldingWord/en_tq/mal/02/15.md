# Why did Yahweh not accept Israelâ€™s offerings?

Because Israel had been faithless against the wife of his youth.

# Why did Yahweh command the Israelites to guard themselves in their spirit and not be faithless?

Because Yahweh had made Israel and his wife one in order to have godly offspring, and because Yahweh hated divorce and him who covers his garment with violence.
