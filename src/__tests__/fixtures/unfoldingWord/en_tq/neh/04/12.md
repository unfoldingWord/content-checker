# What did Nehemiah do after the Jews warned him of the schemes being made against them?

After learning of the schemes against them, Nehemiah positioned people in the lowest parts of the wall, in the bare areas. He positioned each family with their weapons. Nehemiah told the people to not be afraid of their enemies, but to remember the great and fearsome Lord and to fight for their families and homes.
