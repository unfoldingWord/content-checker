# What was done concerning the priests who could not find their genealogical records? What did the Tirshatha restrict them from doing?

The priests who could not find their genealogical records were desecrated from the priesthood. The Tirshatha said that they should not be allowed to eat the holy food from the sacrifices until a priest stood with Urim and Thummim.
