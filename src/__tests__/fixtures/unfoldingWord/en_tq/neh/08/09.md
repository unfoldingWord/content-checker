# Why did Nehemiah, Ezra, and the Levites command all of the people to celebrate with great joy and not to mourn, weep, or grieve?

They commanded the people to celebrate and not to mourn, weep, or grieve because the day was holy to Yahweh their God and because the joy of Yahweh was their strength.
