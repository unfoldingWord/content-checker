# How did Nehemiah respond to Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem when they heard about the work, and mocked and ridiculed the workers?

Nehemiah responded by saying that God would give them success, that they were Godâ€™s servants, and that Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem had no share, no right, and no memorial in Jerusalem.
