# What sin offering did the defiled Nazirite need to bring to the entrance of the tent of meeting with his male lamb for a guilt offering?

He needed to bring a sin offering of a female one year old lamb without blemish, a ram without blemish as a fellowship offering, a basket of bread without leaven, a grain offering, and a drink offering to Yahweh.
