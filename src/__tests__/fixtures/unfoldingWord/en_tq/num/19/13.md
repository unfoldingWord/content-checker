# Why would the person who touched a dead body, but did not purify himself, remain unclean; and what would happen to that man?

The person who touched a dead body and did not purify himself would remain unclean because he had defiled Yahwehâ€™s tabernacle. That man would be cut off from Israel and he would remain unclean.
