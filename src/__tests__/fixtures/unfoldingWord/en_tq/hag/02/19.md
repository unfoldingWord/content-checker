# What were the people to consider from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month forward, the same day on which the foundation of Yahwehâ€™s temple was laid?

They were to consider that there was no seed in the storehouse, and that the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree had still not produced.

# What did Yahweh promise would happen from that day forward?

Yahweh promised that he would bless them from that day forward.
