# Why did the people of Ammon hire twenty thousand Aramean foot soldiers, the king of Maacah with a thousand men, and the men of Tob with twelve thousand men?

The people of Ammon hired all these soldiers when the people of Ammon saw they had become a stench to David.

# Where did the Ammonites and the hired soldiers position themselves?

The Ammonites positioned themselves at the entrance to their city gate, while the Arameans of Zobah and of Rehob, and the men of Tob and Maacah, stood by themselves in the open fields.
