# When was Christ chosen, and when was he revealed?

He was chosen before the foundation of the world; he was revealed to the foreigners, the chosen ones, in what was then the last times.

# How did the believers believe in God, and have faith and confidence in God?

Through Christ, whom God raised from the dead and to whom God gave glory.
