# soul, self

## Definition:

The term "soul" can either refer generally to the non-physical part of a person or refer specifically to a person's awareness of themselves as a person distinct from others.

* In the Bible, the terms “soul” and “spirit” may be two different concepts, or they may be two terms that refer to the same concept.
* When a person dies, his soul leaves his body.
* In contrast to the body, the "soul" can be spoken of as the part of a person that "relates to God."
* The word “soul” is sometimes used figuratively to refer to the whole person. For example, “the soul who sins” means “the person who sins” and “my soul is tired” means,”I am tired.”

## Translation Suggestions:

* The term “soul” could also be translated as “inner self” or “inner person.”
* In some contexts, “my soul” could be translated as “I” or “me.”
* Usually the phrase “the soul” can be translated as “the person” or “he” or “him,” depending on the context.
* Some languages might only have one word for the concepts “soul” and “spirit.”
* In Hebrews 4:12, the figurative phrase “dividing soul and spirit” could mean “deeply discerning or exposing the inner person.”
