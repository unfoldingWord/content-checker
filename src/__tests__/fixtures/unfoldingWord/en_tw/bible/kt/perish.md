# perish

## Definition:

The term “perish” means to die or be destroyed, usually as the result of violence or disaster. In the New Testament, it often has the spiritual meaning of being lost or separated from the people of God. 

### Spiritual Meaning of "Perish:"

* People who are “perishing” are those who have refused to trust in Jesus for their salvation.
* Those who “perish” will not live eternally with God in heaven. Instead, they will live eternally in hell under God's punishment.
* Everyone will die physically, but only those who do not trust in Jesus for their salvation will perish eternally.
* When "perish" is used in a spiritual sense, make sure that your translation expresses this differently than dying physically.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Depending on the context, ways to translate this term could include "be lost from God's people," “die eternally,” “be punished in hell,” or “be destroyed.”
* Try to use a term or expression that does not only mean "die physically" or “cease to exist.”
