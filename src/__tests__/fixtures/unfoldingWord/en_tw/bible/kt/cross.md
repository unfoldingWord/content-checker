# cross

## Definition:

In Bible times, a cross was an upright wooden post stuck into the ground, with a horizontal wooden beam attached to it near the top.

* During the time of the Roman Empire, the Roman government would execute criminals by tying or nailing them to a cross and leaving them there to die.
* Jesus was falsely accused of crimes he did not commit and the Romans put him to death on a cross.
* Note that this is a completely different word from the verb “cross” that means to go over to the other side of something, such as a river or lake.

## Translation Suggestions:

* This term could be translated using a term in the target language that refers to the shape of a cross.

* Also consider how this word is translated in a Bible translation in a local or national language. (See: [How to Translate Unknowns](rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown))
