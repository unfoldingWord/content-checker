# redeem, redeemer, redemption

## Definition:

The term “redeem” refers to buying back something or someone that has been previously owned or held captive.  A “redeemer” is someone who redeems something or someone. 

* God gave laws to the Israelites about how to redeem people or things. For example, someone could redeem a person who was in slavery by paying the price so that the slave could go free. The word “ransom” also refers to this practice.
* If someone’s land had been sold, a relative of that person could “redeem” or “buy back” that land so that it would stay in the family.
* These practices show how God redeems people who are in slavery to sin. When he died on the cross, Jesus paid the full price for people’s sins and redeemed all those who trust in him for salvation. People who have been redeemed by God are set free from sin and its punishment.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Depending on the context, the term “redeem” could also be translated as “buy back” or “pay to free (someone)” or “ransom.”
* The term “redemption” could be translated as “ransom” or “freedom payment” or “buying back.”
* The words “ransom” and “redeem” have basically the same meaning, so some languages may have only one term to translate both these words. The word “ransom,” however, can also mean the payment necessary to "redeem" something or someone.  The term "redeem" never refers to the actual payment itself.
