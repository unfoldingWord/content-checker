# transgress, transgression

## Definition:

The term “transgress” means to cross a line or to violate a boundary.  The term is often used figuratively, meaning to break a command, rule, or moral code. 

* This term is very similar to the word "trespass," but is generally used more often to describe violations against God than against other people.
* To “transgress” can also be described as to “cross a line,” that is, to go beyond a limit or boundary that has been set for the good of the person and others.

## Translation Suggestions:

* To “trangress” could be translated as to “sin” or to “disobey” or to “rebel.”
* If a verse or passage uses two terms that mean “sin” or “transgress” or “trespass,” it is important, if possible, to use different ways to translate these terms. When the Bible uses two or more terms with similar meanings in the same context, usually its purpose is to emphasize what is being said or to show its importance.
