# vow

## Definition:

A "vow" is a solemn promise or oath that a person makes to God.

* If a person in ancient Israel made a vow to God, that person was obligated to fulfill the vow. The ancient Israelites believed that God might punish a person who did not fulfill a vow that he made.
* In ancient Israel, sometimes a person would ask God to protect him or provide for him in exchange for making the vow. However, the ancient Israelites did not believe that God was obligated to fulfill these requests.
* Depending on the context, the term “vow” can be translated as “solemn promise” or "solemn oath" or “promise made to God.”
