# name

## Definition:

The term “name” refers to the word by which a specific person or thing is called. In the Bible, however, the term "name" is used in several different ways to refer to several different concepts.

* In some contexts, “name” could refer to a person’s reputation, as in “let us make a name for ourselves.”
* The term “name” could also refer to the memory of something. For example, “cut off the names of the idols” means to destroy those idols so that they are no longer remembered or worshiped.
* Speaking “in the name of God” meant speaking with his power and authority, or as his representative.
* The “name” of someone could refer to the entire person, as in “there is no other name under heaven by which we must be saved.” (See: [metonymy](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy))

## Translation Suggestions:

* An expression like “his good name” could be translated as “his good reputation.”
* Doing something “in the name of” could be translated as “with the authority of” or “with the permission of” or “as the representative of” that person.
* The expression “make a name for ourselves” could be translated “cause many people to know about us” or “make people think we are very important.”
* The expression “call his name” could be translated as “name him” or “give him the name.”
* The expression “those who love your name” could be translated as “those who love you.”
* The expression “cut off the names of idols” could be translated as “get rid of pagan idols so that they are not even remembered” or  “cause people to stop worshiping false gods” or “completely destroy all idols so that people no longer even think about them.”
