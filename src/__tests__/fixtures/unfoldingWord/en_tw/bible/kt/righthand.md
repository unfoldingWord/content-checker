# right hand

## Definition:

The term "right hand" refers to the hand on the right side of a person's body. In the Bible, the term is often used figuratively to refer to other body parts on a person's right side, to the direction of a person's right, to the direction south, or to a place of honor or strength on the right side of a ruler or other important individual.

* The right hand can be used figuratively as a symbol of power, authority, or strength.
* The Bible describes Jesus as sitting “at the right hand of” God the Father as the head of the body of believers (the Church) and in control as ruler of all creation.
* A person’s right hand was used to show special honor when placed on the head of someone being given a blessing (as when the patriarch Jacob blessed Joseph’s son Ephraim).
* To “serve at the right hand” of someone means to be the one whose service is especially helpful and important to that person.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Sometimes the term “right hand” literally refers to a person’s right hand, as when Roman soldiers put a staff into Jesus’ right hand to mock him. This should be translated using the term that the language uses to refer to this hand. 
* Regarding figurative uses, if an expression that includes the term “right hand” does not have the same meaning in the project language, then consider whether that language has a different expression with the same meaning.
* The expression “at the right hand of” could be translated as “on the right side of” or “in the place of honor beside” or “in the position of strength” or “ready to help.”
* Ways to translate “with his right hand” could include “with authority” or “using power” or “with his amazing strength.”
* The figurative expression “his right hand and his mighty arm” uses two ways of emphasizing God’s power and great strength. One way to translate this expression could be “his amazing strength and mighty power.” (See: [parallelism](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism))
* The expression “their right hand is falsehood” could be translated as, “even the most honorable thing about them is corrupted by lies” or “their place of honor is corrupted by deception” or “they use lies to make themselves powerful.”
