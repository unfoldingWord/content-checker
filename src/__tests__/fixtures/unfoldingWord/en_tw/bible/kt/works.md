# work, works, deeds

## Definition:

The term “work” refers generally either to the action of expending effort in order to accomplish something, or to the result of that action.  The term “works” refers generally to actions as a whole (that is, things that have been done or that need to be done). 

* In the Bible, these terms are commonly used both in reference to God and humans. 
* When used in reference to God, the term "work" in the Bible often refers to God's action of creating the universe or saving his people (either from enemies, from sin, or both).
* God’s works refer to all the things he does or has done, including creating the world, saving sinners, providing for the needs of all creation and keeping the entire universe in place. 
* The works or deeds that a person does can be either good or evil.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Other ways to translate “works” could be “deeds” or “actions” or “things that are done.”
* God’s “works” or “deeds” or the “work of his hands” could also be translated as “miracles” or “mighty acts” or “things that God does.”
* The expression “the work of God” could be translated as “the things that God is doing” or “the miracles God does” or “everything that God has accomplished.”
* The term “work” can just be the singular of “works” as in “every good work” or “every good deed.”
* When work is done for God or others, it can be translated as “service” or “ministry.”
