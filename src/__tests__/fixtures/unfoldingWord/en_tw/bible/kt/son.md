# son

## Definition:

The male offspring of a man and a woman is called their “son” for his entire life.  He is also called a son of that man and a son of that woman. An “adopted son” is a male who has been legally placed into the position of being a son.

* In the Bible, the phrase “son of” can be used to identify a person's father, mother, or an ancestor from some previous generation. This phrase is used in genealogies and many other places.
* Using “son of” to give the name of the father frequently helps distinguish people who have the same name. For example, “Azariah son of Zadok” and “Azariah son of Nathan” in 1 Kings 4, and “Azariah son of Amaziah” in 2 Kings 15 are three different men.

## Translation Suggestions:

* In most occurrences of this term, it is best to translate “son” by the literal term in the language that is used to refer to a son.
* When translating the term “Son of God,” the project language’s common term for “son” should be used.
* Sometimes “sons” can be translated as “children,” when both males and females are being referred to. For example, “sons of God” could be translated as “children of God” since this expression also includes girls and women.
