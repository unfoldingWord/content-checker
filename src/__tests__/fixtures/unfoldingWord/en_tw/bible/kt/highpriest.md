# high priest, chief priests

## Definition:

The term “high priest” refers to a special priest who was appointed to serve for one year as the leader of all of the other Israelite priests. In New Testament times, some other priests were also considered very important Jewish religious leaders, with authority over other priests and the people. These were the chief priests.

* The high priest had special responsibilities. He was the only one who was permitted to go into the most holy part of the tabernacle or the temple to offer a special sacrifice once per year.
* The Israelites had many priests, but only one high priest at a time.
* After high priests retired, they still kept the title, along with some of the responsibilities of the office. For example, Annas was still referred to as high priest during the priesthood of Caiaphas and others.
* The chief priests were responsible for everything needed for the worship services at the temple. They were also in charge of the money that was given to the temple.
* The chief priests were higher in rank and power than the ordinary priests. Only the high priest had more authority.
* The chief priests were some of Jesus’ main enemies and they strongly influenced the Roman leaders to arrest and kill him.

## Translation Suggestions:

* “High priest” could be translated as “supreme priest” or “highest ranking priest.”
* The term “chief priests” could be translated as “head priests” or “leading priests” or “ruling priests.”
