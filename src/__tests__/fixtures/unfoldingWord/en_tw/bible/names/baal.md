# Baal

## Facts:

“Baal” means “lord” or “master” and was the name of the primary false god that was worshiped by the Canaanites.

* There were also local false gods that had “Baal” as part of their names, such as “Baal of Peor.” Sometimes all these gods together are referred to as “the Baals.”
* Some people had names that included the word “Baal” in them.
* The worship of Baal included evil practices such as sacrificing children and using prostitutes.
* At different time periods throughout their history, the Israelites also became deeply involved in Baal worship, following the example of the pagan nations around them.
* During the reign of King Ahab, God’s prophet Elijah set up a test to prove to the people that Baal does not exist and that Yahweh is the only true God. As a result, the prophets of Baal were destroyed and the people started worshiping Yahweh again.
