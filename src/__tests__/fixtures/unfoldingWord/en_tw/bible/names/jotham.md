# Jotham

## Definition:

In the Old Testament, there were three men with the name Jotham.

* One man named Jotham was the youngest son of Gideon. Jotham helped defeat his older brother Abimelech, who had killed all the rest of their brothers.
* Another man named Jotham was a king over Judah for sixteen years following the death of his father Uzziah (Azariah).
* Like his father, King Jotham obeyed God and was a good king.
* However, by not removing the places of idol worship he caused the people of Judah to later turn away from God again.
* Jotham is also one of the ancestors listed in the genealogy of Jesus Christ in the book of Matthew.
