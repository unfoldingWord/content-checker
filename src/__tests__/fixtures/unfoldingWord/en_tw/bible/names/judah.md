# Judah

## Facts:

Judah was one of Jacob’s older sons. His mother was Leah. His descendants were called the “tribe of Judah.” When used as the name of a region of land, the term "Judah" refers to the land given to the tribe of Judah, which includes the mountainous area to the south of the city of Jerusalem.

* It was Judah who told his brothers to sell their younger brother Joseph as a slave instead of leaving him to die in a deep pit.
* King David and all the kings after him were descendants of Judah. Jesus, too, was a descendant of Judah.
* When Solomon’s reign ended and the nation of Israel divided, the kingdom of Judah was the southern kingdom.
