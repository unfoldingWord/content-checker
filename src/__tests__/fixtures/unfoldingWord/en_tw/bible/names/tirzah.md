# Tirzah

## Facts:

Tirzah was an important Canaanite city that was conquered by the Israelites. It was also the name of a daughter of Gilead, a descendant of Manasseh.

* The city Tirzah was located in the region occupied by the tribe of Manasseh. It is thought that the city was about 10 miles north of the city of Shechem.
* Years later, Tirzah became a temporary capital city of the northern kingdom of Israel, during the reigns of four kings of Israel.
* Tirzah was also the name of one of Manasseh’s granddaughters. They asked to be given a portion of the land since their father had died and he had no sons to inherit it as would normally be the custom.
