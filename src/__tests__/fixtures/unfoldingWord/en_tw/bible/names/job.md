## Facts:

Job was a man who is described in the Bible as blameless and righteous before God. He is best known for persevering in his faith in God through times of terrible suffering.

* Job lived in the land of Uz, which was located somewhere east of the land of Canaan, possibly near the region of the Edomites.
