# Tyre, Tyrians

## Facts:

Tyre was an ancient Canaanite city located on the coast of the Mediterranean Sea in a region that is now part of the modern-day country of Lebanon. Its people were called “Tyrians.”

* Part of the city was located on an island in the sea, about one kilometer from the mainland.
* Because of its location and its valuable natural resources, such as cedar trees, Tyre had a prosperous trading industry and was very wealthy.
* King Hiram of Tyre sent wood from cedar trees and skilled laborers to help build a palace for King David.
* Years later, Hiram also sent King Solomon wood and skilled laborers to help build the temple. Solomon paid him with large amounts of wheat and olive oil.
* Tyre was often associated with the nearby ancient city of Sidon. These were the most important cities of the region of Canaan called Phoenicia.
