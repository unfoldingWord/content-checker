# Manasseh

## Facts:

There were five men by the name of Manasseh in the Old Testament: 

* Manasseh was the name of Joseph’s firstborn son.
* Both Manasseh and his younger brother Ephraim were adopted by Joseph’s father, Jacob which gave their descendants the privilege of being among the twelve tribes of Israel.
* The descendants of Manasseh formed one of the tribes of Israel.
* The tribe of Manasseh was often called the “half-tribe of Manasseh” because only part of the tribe settled in the land of Canaan, on the west side of the Jordan River. The other part of the tribe settled on the east side of the Jordan.
 
* One of the kings of Judah was also named Manasseh.
* King Manasseh was an evil king who sacrificed his own children as burnt offerings to false gods.
* God punished King Manasseh by allowing him to be captured by an enemy army. Manasseh turned back to God and destroyed the altars where idols were worshiped.
* Two men named Manasseh lived during the time of Ezra. These men were required to divorce their pagan wives, who had influenced them to worship false gods.
* One other Manasseh was the grandfather of some Danites who were priests for false gods.
