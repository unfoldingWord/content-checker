# Vashti

## Facts:

In the Old Testament book of Esther, Vashti was the wife of Ahasuerus, king of Persia.

* King Ahasuerus sent Queen Vashti away when she refused to obey his order to come to his dinner party and show off her beauty to his drunken guests.
* As a result, a search went out for a new queen and eventually Esther was chosen to be the king’s new wife.
