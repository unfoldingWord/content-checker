# Judas son of James

## Facts:

Judas son of James was one of Jesus’ twelve apostles. Note that he was not the same man as Judas Iscariot.

* Another man named Judas was Jesus’ brother. He was also known as “Jude.”
* The New Testament book called “Jude” was probably written by Jesus’ brother Judas, since the author identified himself as the “brother of James.” James was another brother of Jesus.
