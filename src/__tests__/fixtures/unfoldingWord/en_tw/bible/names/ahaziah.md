# Ahaziah

## Facts:

Ahaziah was the name of two kings: one ruled over the kingdom of Israel, and the other ruled over the kingdom of Judah.

* Judah’s King Ahaziah was the son of King Jehoram. He reigned for one year (841 B.C.) and then was killed by Jehu. Ahaziah’s young son Joash eventually took his place as king.
