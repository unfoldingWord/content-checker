# Ruth

## Facts:

Ruth was a Moabite woman who lived during the time when judges were leading Israel. In Moab, she married an Israelite man named Mahlon after his family had moved there because of a famine in Israel. Mahlon died, and some time after that she left Moab with her mother-in-law Naomi to return to the city of Bethlehem in Israel.

* Ruth was loyal to Naomi and worked hard to provide food for her.
* She also committed herself to serving the one true God of Israel.
* Ruth married an Israelite man named Boaz and gave birth to a son named Obed. Obed became the grandfather of King David, and King David was an ancestor of Jesus.
