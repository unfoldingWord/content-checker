# Gilgal

## Facts:

Gilgal was a town north of Jericho and was the first place that the Israelites camped after crossing the Jordan River to enter Canaan.

* At Gilgal, Joshua set up twelve stones taken from the dry river bed of the Jordan River that they had just crossed over.
* Gilgal was the city that Elijah and Elisha were leaving as they crossed the Jordan when Elijah was taken up to heaven.
* There were also several other places called “Gilgal” in the Old Testament.
* The word “gilgal” means “circle of stones,” perhaps referring to a place where a circular altar was built.
* In the Old Testament, this name almost always occurs as “the gilgal.” This may indicate that it was not a specific place name but rather was a description of a certain kind of place.
