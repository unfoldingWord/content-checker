# time, untimely, date

## Facts:

In the Bible the term “time” was often used figuratively to refer to a specific season or period of time when certain events took place. It has a meaning similar to “age” or “epoch” or “season.”

* In both Daniel and Revelation speak of a “time” of great trouble or tribulation that will come upon the earth.
* In the phrase “time, times, and half a time” the term “time” means “year.” This phrase refers to a three-and-a-half-year period of time during the great tribulation at the end of this present age.
* “Time” can mean “occasion” in a phrase like “third time.” The phrase “many times” can mean “on many occasions.”
* To be “on time” means to arrive when expected, not late.
* Depending on the context, the term “time” could be translated as, “season” or “time period” or “moment” or “event” or “occurrence.”
* The phrase “times and seasons” is a figurative expression which states the same idea twice. This could also be translated as “certain events happening in certain time periods.” (See: [doublet](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet))
