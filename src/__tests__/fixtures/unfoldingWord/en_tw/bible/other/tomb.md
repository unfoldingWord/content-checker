# grave, gravediggers, tomb, burial place

## Definition:

The terms “tomb” and “grave” refer to a place where people put the body of a person who has died. A “burial place” is a more general term that also refers to this.

* The Jews sometimes used natural caves as tombs, and sometimes they dug caves into rock in the side of a hill.
* In New Testament times, it was common to roll a large, heavy stone in front of the opening of a tomb in order to close it.
* If the target language the word for a tomb can only refer to a hole in which the body is placed below the ground, other ways to translate this could include “cave” or “hole in the side of a hill.”
* The phrase “the grave” is often used generally and figuratively to refer to the condition of being dead or a place where the souls of dead people are.
