# sorcerer, sorceress, sorcery, sorceries, witchcraft, magician

## Definition:

“Sorcery” or “witchcraft” refers to using magic, which involves doing powerful things through the help of evil spirits. A “sorcerer” is someone who does these powerful, magical things.

* The use of magic and sorcery can involve both beneficial things (such as healing someone) and harmful things (such as putting a curse on someone). But all kinds of sorcery are wrong, because they use the power of evil spirits.
* In the Bible, God says that the use of sorcery is as evil as other terrible sins (such as adultery, worshiping idols, and child sacrifice).
* The terms “sorcery” and “witchcraft” could also be translated as “evil spirit power” or “casting spells.”
* Possible ways to translated “sorcerer” could include “worker of magic” or “person who casts spells” or “person who does miracles using evil spirit power.”
* Note that “sorcery” has a different meaning than the term “divination,” which refers to attempting to contact the spirit world.
