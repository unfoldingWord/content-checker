# sword, swordsmen

## Definition:

A sword is a flat-bladed metal weapon used to cut or stab. It has a handle and a long, pointed blade with a very sharp cutting edge.

* In ancient times the length of a sword’s blade was about 60 to 91 centimeters.
* Some swords have two sharp edges and are called “double-edged” or “two-edged” swords.
* Jesus’ disciples had swords for self defense. With his sword, Peter cut off the ear of the high priest’s servant.
* Both John the Baptist and the apostle James were beheaded with swords.

## Translation Suggestions

* A sword is used as a metaphor for God’s word. God’s teachings in the Bible exposed people’s innermost thoughts and convicted them of their sin. In a similar way, a sword cuts deeply, causing pain. (See: [Metaphor](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor))
* One way to translate this figurative use would be, “God’s word is like a sword, which cuts deeply and exposes sin.”
* Another figurative use of this term occurred in the book of Psalms, where the tongue or speech of a person was compared to a sword, which can injure people. This could be translated as “the tongue is like a sword that can badly injure someone.”
* If swords are not known in your culture, this word could be translated with the name of another long-bladed weapon that is used to cut or stab.
* A sword could also be described as a “sharp weapon” or “long knife.” Some translations could include a picture of a sword.
