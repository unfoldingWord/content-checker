# oak

## Definition:

An oak, or oak tree,  is a tall shade tree with a large trunk and wide spreading branches.

* Oak trees have strong, hard wood that was used to build ships and to make farming plows, oxen yokes and walking sticks.
* The seed of an oak tree is called an acorn.
* The trunks of certain oak trees could bemeasured up to 6 meters around.
* Oak trees were symbolic of long life and had other spiritual meanings. In the Bible, they were often associated with holy places.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Many translations will find it important to use the term “oak tree” rather than just the word “oak.”
* If oak trees are not known in the receptor area, “an oak” could be translated as “an oak, which is a large shade tree like…,” then give the name of a local tree that has similar characteristics.
