# it is written

## Definition:

The phrase “as it is written” or “what is written” occurs frequently in the New Testament and usually refers to commands or prophecies that were written in the Hebrew scriptures.

* Sometimes “as it is written” refers to what was written in the Law of Moses.
* Other times it is a quote from what one of the prophets wrote in the Old Testament.
* This could be translated “as it is written in the Law of Moses” or “as the prophets wrote long ago” or “what it says in God’s laws that Moses wrote down long ago”.
* Another option is to keep “It is written” and give a footnote that explains what this means.
