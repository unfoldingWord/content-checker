# cure, cured, heal, healed, healing, healer, health, healthy, unhealthy

## Definition:

The terms “heal” and “cure” both mean to cause a sick, wounded, or disabled person to be healthy again.

* A person who is “healed” or “cured” has been “made well” or “made healthy.”
* Healing can happen naturally since God gave our bodies the ability to recover from many kinds of wounds and diseases. Thsi kind of healing usually happens slowly.
* However, certain conditions, such as being blind or paralyzed, and certain serious diseases, such as leprosy, however do not heal on their own. When people are healed of these things, it is a miracle that usually happens suddenly.
* For example, Jesus healed many people who were blind or lame or diseased, and they became well right away.
* The apostles also healed people miraculously, such as when Peter caused a crippled man to immediately be able to walk.
