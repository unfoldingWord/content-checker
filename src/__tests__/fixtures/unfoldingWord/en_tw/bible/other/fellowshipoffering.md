# fellowship offering

## Facts:

In the Old Testament, the “fellowship offering” was a kind of sacrifice that was offered for different reasons, such as to give thanks to God or to fulfill a vow. 

* This offering required the sacrifice of an animal that could be male or female. This was different from the burnt offering, which required a male animal.
* After giving a portion of the sacrifice to God, the person who brought the fellowship offering shared the meat with the priests and other Israelites.
* There was a meal associated with this offering which included unleavened bread.
* This is sometimes called the “peace offering.”
