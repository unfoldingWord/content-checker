# decree, decreed

## Definition:

The term "decree" means to give an order that must be obeyed.  The order itself can also be called a "decree."

* A "decree" is similar to a "law," but is generally used more often to refer to something spoken rather than written.
* The term "decree" could be translated as to “order” or to “command” or to “formally require” or to “publicly make a law.”
* God’s laws are also called decrees, statutes, or commandments.
* An example of a decree by a human ruler was the proclamation by Caesar Augustus that everyone living in the Roman Empire must go back to their hometown in order to be counted in a census.
