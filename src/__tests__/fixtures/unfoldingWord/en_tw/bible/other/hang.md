# hang, hung

## Definition:

The term “hang” means to suspend something or someone above the ground.

* In modern times, death by hanging is usually done by tying a rope around a person’s neck and suspending him from an elevated object until he dies. This elevated object can be any number of things, such as a tree or a gallows, that is, a platform built specifically for the purpose of hanging a person in order to kill him. 
* In biblical times, however, ancient cultures may not have killed people by hanging in precisely the same way. For example, Jesus died while hanging on a wooden cross (sometimes called a "tree"), but there was nothing around his neck. The soldiers suspended him by nailing his hands (or wrists) and his feet to the cross.
* Some ancient cultures "hung" a person by impaling him on a wooden pole in such a way that he was suspended above the ground so that he could not escape. The person would be left there until he died. 
* For many references to death by "hanging" in the Bible, the specific means of death is unknown.
