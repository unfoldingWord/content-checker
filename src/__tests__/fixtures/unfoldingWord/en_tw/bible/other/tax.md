## Examples from the Bible stories:

34:06 He said, “Two men went to the Temple to pray. One of them was a tax collector, and the other was a religious leader.”
34:07 “The religious leader prayed like this, ‘Thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like other men—such as robbers, unjust men, adulterers, or even like that tax collector.’”
34:09 “But the tax collector stood far away from the religious ruler, did not even look up to heaven. Instead, he pounded on his chest and prayed, ‘God, please be merciful to me because I am a sinner.’”
34:10 Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, God heard the tax collector’s prayer and declared him to be righteous.”
