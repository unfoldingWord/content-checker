# dove, pigeon

## Definition:

Doves and pigeons are two kinds of small, gray-brown birds that look similar. A dove is often thought of as being lighter in color, almost white.

* Some languages have two different names for them, while others use the same name for both.
* Doves and pigeons were used in sacrifices to God, especially for people who could not afford to buy a larger animal.
* A dove brought the leaf of an olive tree to Noah when the flood waters were going down.
* Doves sometimes symbolize purity, innocence, or peace.
* If doves or pigeons are not known in the language area where the translation is being done, this term could be translated as “a small grayish brown bird called a dove” or “a small gray or brown bird, similar to a (name of local bird)”.
* If both a dove and a pigeon are referred to in the same verse, it is best to use two different words for these birds, if possible.
