# locust

## Facts:

The term “locust” refers to a type of large, flying grasshopper that sometimes flies with many other of its kind in a very destructive swarm that eats all vegetation. 
 
* Locusts and other grasshoppers are large, straight-winged insects with long, jointed back legs that give them the ability to jump a long distance way.
* In the Old Testament, swarming locusts were referred to figuratively as a symbol or picture of the overwhelming devastation that would come as a result of Israel’s disobedience.
* God sent locusts as one of the ten plagues against the Egyptians. 
* The New Testament says that locusts were a main source of food for John the Baptist while he was living in the desert.
