# cistern, well

## Definition:

The terms “well” and “cistern” refer to two different kinds of sources for water in Bible times.

* A well is a deep hole dug into the ground so that underground water can flow into it.
* A cistern is a deep hole dug into rock that was used as a holding tank for collecting rain water.
* Cisterns were usually dug into rock and sealed with plaster to keep the water in. A “broken cistern” happened when the plaster became cracked so that the water leaked out.
* Cisterns were often located in the courtyard area of people’s homes to catch the rainwater that would run off the roof.
* Wells were often located where they could be accessed by several families or a whole community.
* Because water was very important for both people and livestock, the right to use a well was often a cause of strife and conflict.
* Both wells and cisterns were usually covered with a large stone to prevent anything falling in it. Often there was a rope with a bucket or pot attached to it to bring the water up to the surface.
* Sometimes a dry cistern was used as a place to imprison someone, such as happened to Joseph and Jeremiah.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Ways to translate “well” could include “deep water hole” or “deep hole for spring water” or “deep hole for drawing water.”
* The term “cistern” could be translated as “stone water pit” or “deep and narrow pit for water” or “underground tank for holding water.”
* These terms are similar in meaning. The main difference is that a well continually receives water from underground springs, whereas a cistern is a holding tank for water that usually comes from rain.
