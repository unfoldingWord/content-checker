## Facts:

The terms “mourn” and “mourning” refer to expressing deep grief, usually in response to the death of someone.

* In many cultures, mourning includes specific outward behaviors that show this sadness and grief.
* The Israelites and other people groups in ancient times expressed mourning through loud wailing and lamenting. They also wore rough clothing made of sackcloth and put ashes on themselves.
* Hired mourners, usually women, would loudly weep and wail from the time of death until well after the body was put in the tomb.
