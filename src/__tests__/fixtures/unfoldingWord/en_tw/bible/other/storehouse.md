# storehouse

## Definition:

A “storehouse” is a large building that is used for keeping food or other things, often for a long time.

* In the Bible a “storehouse” was usually used to store extra grain and other food to be used later when there was a famine.
* This term was also used figuratively to refer to all the good things that God wants to give to his people.
* The storehouses of the temple contained valuable things that had been dedicated to Yahweh, such as gold and silver. Some of these things used to repair and maintain the temple were also kept there.
* Other ways to translate “storehouse” could include “a building for storing grain” or “place for keeping food” or “room for keeping valuable things safe.”
