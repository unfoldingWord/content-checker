# freewill offering

## Definition:

A freewill offering was a type of sacrifice to God that was not required by the Law of Moses. It was a person’s own choice to give this offering.

* If the freewill offering was an animal to be sacrificed, the animal was permitted to have slight defects since it was a voluntary offering.
* The Israelites ate the sacrificed animal as part of a celebration feast.
* When a freewill offering could be given, this was a cause of rejoicing for Israel since it showed that the harvest had been good so that the people had plenty of food.
* The book of Ezra describes a different type of freewill offering that was brought for rebuilding the temple. This offering consisted of gold and silver money, as well as bowls and other objects made of gold and silver.
