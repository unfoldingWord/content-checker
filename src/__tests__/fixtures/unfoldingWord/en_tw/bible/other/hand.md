# hand

## Definition:

The word “hand” refers to the part of the body at the end of the arm.  This term is often used figuratively to refer to a person's power, control, or action, whether it be in reference to God or in reference to a human person.
 

Some of the various uses of the term “hand” include the following:

* The term "hand" can be used figuratively to refer to the position of being "beside" a person, an object, or a location.
* To “lay a hand on” means to “harm.” To “save from the hand of” means to prevent someone from being harmed by another person.
* The position of being “on the right hand” means “on the right side” or “to the right.”
* The expression “by the hand of” someone means “by” or “through” the action of that person. For example, the phrase “by the hand of the Lord” means that God caused something to happen.
* Expressions such as “hand over to” or “deliver into the hands of” refer to causing someone to be under the control or power of someone else. 
* The term “laying on of hands” can refer to placing a hand on a person in order to dedicate that person to God’s service, to pray for healing, or to ask God to bless that person.
* When Paul says “written by my hand,” it means that he himself wrote that part of the letter rather than speaking it to someone else to write down.

## Translation Suggestions

* These expressions and other figures of speech could be translated using other figurative expressions that have the same meaning. Or the meaning could be translated using direct, literal language (see examples above).
* The expression “handed him the scroll” could also be translated as “gave him the scroll” or “put the scroll in his hand.” It was not given to him permanently, but just for the purpose of using it at that time.
* An expression such as “delivered them into the hands of their enemies” or “handed them over to their enemies,” could be translated as, “allowed their enemies to conquer them” or “caused them to be captured by their enemies” or “empowered their enemies to gain control over them.”
* To “die by the hand of” could be translated as “be killed by.”
* The expression “on the right hand of” could be translated as “on the right side of.”
* In regard to Jesus being “seated at the right hand of God,” if this does not communicate in the language that it refers to a position of high honor and equal authority, a different expression with that meaning could be used. Or a short explanation could be added: “on the right side of God, in the position of highest authority.”
