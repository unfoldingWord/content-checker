# darkness

## Definition:

The term “darkness” literally means an absence of light. There are also several figurative meanings of this term:

* As a metaphor, “darkness” means “impurity” or “evil” or “spiritual blindness.”
* It also refers to anything related to sin and moral corruption.
* The expression “dominion of darkness” refers to all that is evil and ruled by Satan.
* The term “darkness” can also be used as a metaphor for death. (See: [Metaphor](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor))
* People who do not know God are said to be “living in darkness,” which means they do not understand or practice righteousness.
* God is light (righteousness) and the darkness (evil) cannot overcome that light.
* The place of punishment for those who reject God is sometimes referred to as “outer darkness.”

## Translation Suggestions:

* It is best to translate this term literally, with a word in the project language that refers to the absence of light. This could also be a term that refers to the darkness of a room with no light or to the time of day when there is no light.
* For the figurative uses, it is also important to keep the image of darkness in contrast to light, as a way to describe evil and deception in contrast to goodness and truth.
* Depending on the context, other ways to translate this could be, “darkness of night” (as opposed to “light of day”) or “not seeing anything, like at night” or “evil, like a dark place”.
