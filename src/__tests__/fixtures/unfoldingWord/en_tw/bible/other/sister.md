# sister

## Definition:

A sister is a female person who shares at least one biological parent with another person. She is said to be that other person’s sister or the sister of that other person.

* In the New Testament, “sister” is also used figuratively to refer to a woman who is a fellow believer in Jesus Christ.
* Sometimes the phrase “brothers and sisters” is used to refer to all believers in Christ, both men and women.
* In the Old Testament book Song of Songs, “sister” refers to a female lover or spouse.

## Translation Suggestions:

* It is best to translate this term with the literal word that is used in the target language to refer to a natural or biological sister, unless this would give wrong meaning.
* Other ways to translate this could include “sister in Christ” or “spiritual sister” or “woman who believes in Jesus” or “fellow woman believer.”
* If possible, it is best to use a family term.
* If the language has a feminine form for “believer,” this may be a possible way to translate this term.
* When referring to a lover or wife, this could be translated using a feminine form of “loved one” or “dear one.”
