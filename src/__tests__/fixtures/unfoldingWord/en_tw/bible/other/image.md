* A “carved image” or “carved figure” is a wooden object that has been made to look like an animal, person, or thing.
* A “cast metal figure” is an object or statue created by melting metal and pouring it into a mold that is in the shape of an object, animal, or person.
* These wooden and metal objects were used in the worship of false gods.
* The term “image” when referring to an idol could either refer to a wooden or metal idol.

## Translation Suggestions:

* When referring to an idol, the term “image” could also be translated as “statue” or “engraved idol” or “carved religious object.”
* It may be more clear in some languages to always use a descriptive word with this term, such as “carved image” or “cast metal figure,” even in places where only the term “image” or “figure” is in the original text.
* Make sure it is clear that this term is different than the term used to refer to being in the image of God.
