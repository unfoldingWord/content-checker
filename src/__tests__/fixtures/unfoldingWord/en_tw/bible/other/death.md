# die, dead, deadly, death,

## Definition:

The term "death" refers to being physically dead instead of alive.

### 1. Physical death

* To “die” means to stop living. Death is the end of physical life.
* The expression “put to death” refers to killing or murdering someone, especially when a king or other ruler gives an order for someone to be killed.

### 2. Eternal death

* Eternal death is the separation of a person from God. 
* This is the kind of death that happened to Adam when he sinned and disobeyed God. His relationship with God was broken. He became ashamed and tried to hide from God. 
* This same kind of death happens to every person, because we sin. But God gives us eternal life when we have faith in Jesus Christ.

## Translation Suggestions:

* To translate this term, it is best to use the everyday, natural word or expression in the target language that refers to death.
* In some languages, to “die” may be expressed as to “not live.” The term “dead” may be translated as “not alive” or “not having any life” or “not living.”
* Many languages use figurative expressions to describe death, such as to “pass away” in English. However, in the Bible it is best to use the most direct term for death that is used in everyday language.
* In the Bible, eternal life and eternal death are often compared to physical life and physical death. It is important in a translation to use the same word or phrase for both physical death and eternal death.
* In some languages it may be more clear to say “eternal death” when the context requires that meaning. Some translators may also feel it is best to say “physical death” in contexts where it is being contrasted to spiritual death.
* The expression “the dead” is a nominal adjective that refers to people who have died. Some languages will translate this as “dead people” or “people who have died.”  (See: [nominal adjective](rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj))
* The expression “put to death” could also be translated as “kill” or “murder” or “execute.”
