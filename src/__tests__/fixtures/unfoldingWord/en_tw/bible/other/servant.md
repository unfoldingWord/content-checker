# servant, serve, slave, worker, young man, young women

## Definition:

The term “serve" generally means to do work, and the concept can be applied in a wide variety of contexts. The term refers to a person who works for (or obeys) another person, either by choice or by force.  In the Bible, any of the following people might be called a "servant:" a slave, a young female worker, a young male worker, someone who obeys God, and others.  In biblical times, there was less of a difference between a "servant" and a "slave" than there is today. Both servants and slaves were an important part of a household, and many servants were treated almost like members of the family. Sometimes a servant would choose to become a lifetime servant to his master.

* A slave was a kind of servant who was the property of the person he worked for. The person who bought a slave was called his “owner” or “master.” Some masters treated their slaves very cruelly, while other masters treated their slaves very well, as a servant who was a valued member of the household.
* In ancient times, some people willingly became slaves to a person they owed money to in order to pay off their debt to that person.
* In the context of a person serving guests, this term means “care for” or “serve food to” or “provide food for.” When Jesus told the disciples to “serve” the fish to the people, this could be translated as, “distribute” or “hand out” or “give.”
* In the Bible, the phrase “I am your servant” was used as a sign of respect and service to a person of higher rank, such as a king. It did not mean that the person speaking was an actual servant.
* The term “serve” can also be translated as “minister to” or “work for” or “take care of” or “obey,” depending on the context.
* In the Old Testament, God’s prophets and other people who worshiped God were often referred to as his “servants.”
* To “serve God” can be translated as to “worship and obey God” or to “do the work that God has commanded.”
* In the New Testament, people who obeyed God through faith in Christ were often called his “servants.”
* To “serve tables” means to bring food to people who are sitting at tables, or more generally, to “distribute food.”
* People who teach others about God are said to serve both God and the ones they are teaching.
* The apostle Paul wrote to the Corinthian Christians about how they used to “serve” the old covenant. This refers to obeying the laws of Moses. Now they “serve” the new covenant. That is, because of Jesus’ sacrifice on the cross, believers in Jesus are enabled by the Holy Spirit to please God and live holy lives.
* Paul talks about their actions in terms of their “service” to either the old or new covenant. This could be translated as “serving” or “obeying” or “devotion to.”
