## Definition:

A false prophet is a person who wrongly claims that his message comes from God.

* False prophets teach messages that partially or totally contradict what the Bible says.
* This term could also be translated as “person who falsely claims to be God’s spokesman” or “someone who falsely claims to speak God’s words.”
* The New Testament teaches that in the end times there will be many false prophets who will try to deceive people into thinking that they come from God.
