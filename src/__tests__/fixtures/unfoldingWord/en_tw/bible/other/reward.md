# reward, prize, deserve,

## Definition:

The term “reward” refers to what a person receives because of something he has done, either good or bad. To “reward” someone is to give someone something he deserves. However, this is different than the concept of "wages," which refers to payment (often money) given in exchange for work performed.

* A reward can be a good or positive thing that a person receives because he has done something well or because he has obeyed God.
* Sometimes a reward can refer to negative things that may result from bad behavior, such as the statement “the reward of the wicked.” In this context “reward” refers to the punishment or negative consequences they receive because of their sinful actions.

## Translation Suggestions:

* Depending on the context, the term “reward” could be translated as “payment” or “something that is deserved” or “punishment.”
* To “reward” someone could be translated by to “repay” or to “punish” or to “give what is deserved.”
* Make sure the translation of this term does not refer to wages. A reward is not specifically about earning money as part of a job.
