# clan

## Definition:

The term “clan” refers to a group of extended family members who come from a common ancestor.

* Clans were normally named after their most well-known ancestor.
* Individual people were sometimes referred to by the name of their clan. An example of this is when Moses’ father-in-law Jethro is sometimes called by his clan name, Reuel.
