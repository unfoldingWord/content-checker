Joseph believed that Mary was pregnant because she had been unfaithful to him and had slept with another man. Joseph could have been angry with Mary and wanted to punish her. Joseph was a righteous man, and did not want to marry an adulteress. However, he was a good man, and it appears that he loved Mary. Therefore, he decided to have mercy on her instead of punishing her.
23:10	s7g6	application			How might Mary have felt when people learned that she was pregnant?	Mary must have been very sad when people learned that she was pregnant, because they did not believe that her baby was from the Holy Spirit. Everyone thought she was an adulteress.

She waited patiently until God told Joseph that she was faithful, and that he should marry her.
23:10	qvcg	application			Why did Joseph not sleep with Mary until the baby was born?	God told Joseph that Mary was a virgin and that the baby inside her was from God. Perhaps Joseph was so amazed that the Son of God was in Mary’s womb that he kept her a virgin. Or perhaps he wanted to be able to tell everyone that Mary’s baby could not possibly be the result of a human father. Therefore, he did not sleep with her until Jesus was born.
23:10	vc21	application			How was the location of Jesus’ birth different than where you would expect the Son of God to be born?	Joseph and Mary were forced to travel far away to another city while she was pregnant. She gave birth to Jesus in a place where animals were kept. They were too poor to be able to find a proper room to stay in. None of their family or friends were with them. Joseph and Mary honored and obeyed God. And Jesus was the Messiah, the Son of God. However, they still faced many difficult situations. But God took care of them during that time.
23:10	an2l	application			What did God do to encourage Joseph and Mary after Jesus was born?	God sent the shepherds to tell Joseph and Mary about the angels that visited them. He also sent the wise men who brought expensive gifts and worshiped Jesus.

24:9	mhqx	application			John told people to repent, for the kingdom of God was near. Why was his message so simple?	John’s message was indeed very simple.

People had to repent of their sins if they wanted to participate in that kingdom.
24:9	wpkv	application			Why do you think the religious rulers came to John?	The religious rulers did not come to John to repent of their sins. Perhaps they were curious about why other people were coming to see him. Or perhaps they were jealous that people were coming to John instead of coming to them.

24:9	l0mj	application			How did John show that he was a humble man?	John openly said that he was not the Messiah, and that he was not worthy to untie the sandals of the Messiah.

25:8	lef4	application			Why did Satan quote from the scripture when he told Jesus to jump off the top of the Temple?	Satan knows the scripture and can quote it. However, he does not use the scripture in the correct way. He tries to give the scripture meanings that God did not intend for it to have. Satan only uses the scripture to deceive people.

25:8	ucyq	application			Why was it impossible for Jesus to worship Satan even for a short time in order to receive the kingdoms of this world from Satan?	God demands that people serve him alone.

Because the people of Nazareth knew Jesus when he was a little boy, they continued to think of him as an unimportant person. Therefore, it was hard for them to believe that he was the Messiah. For this reason, Jesus said that people do not accept a prophet in the town where he grew up. Have you seen this happen?
26:10	wscu	application			Jesus did not directly tell the people of Nazareth that he was the Messiah. Instead, he read the scripture and said it was happening right then. Why do you think Jesus revealed himself in this way?	Jesus knew that the people of Nazareth did not want to accept that he was the Messiah. Therefore, instead of stating that as a fact, he read the scripture and said that it was talking about him. If the people of Nazareth wanted to know who he was, they could see that he was doing all the things that the scripture said the Messiah would do. If they were willing to believe in him, they could figure out for themselves from the scripture that he was the Messiah.
26:10	sst1	application			Why were the Jews so angry when Jesus told them what Elijah and Elisha did?	The Jews believed that God loved only Jews, and would not help people from other nations.

But he did not send them to help the Jews when the Jews did not serve him.
26:10	tkaf	application			Why did Jesus choose 12 men to be his apostles?	Jesus knew that he would die for our sins.

The man knew far more about the Jewish law than any other person in Israel. He continually studied it and taught it to others. However, he did not really understand what the law meant. Therefore, Jesus started questioning him about the law so that he could show the man that he did not really know what God’s law taught.
27:11	o71u	application			Why do you think the man asked Jesus who his neighbor was?	The man knew God’s law said to love his neighbor as himself. But he also knew that he did not love other people as he should. Therefore, he asked about his neighbor because he was hoping that he only needed to love a few specific people in order to obey the law.
27:11	obx3	application			Why might Jesus have chosen to talk to this man about a priest and a Levite?	The Jews considered the priests and Levites to be the most spiritual people in Israel. They also considered the experts in the law to be very much like the priests and the Levites. Because the experts studied and taught God’s law, people assumed they knew more about God than other people did.
27:11	fjdh	application			Why might the expert in the Jewish law have been offended when Jesus compared the actions of the priest and the Levite to the actions of the Samaritan?	The expert in the Jewish law considered the priests and the Levites to be good people, but he hated the Samaritan. He thought all Samaritans were sinners. However, in the story that Jesus told him, the Samaritan was the only person who acted kindly to the injured Jewish man.
27:11	vmjd	application			How much did the Samaritan show mercy to the injured man?	The Samaritan did not merely help the injured man a little bit.

27:11	e233	application			What does the story tell us about loving our neighbor?	The Samaritan saw another person who had a serious need. Although the man was a stranger from a people that the Samaritans hated, he felt compassion for him. He took care of the man, doing more than was necessary or expected to help him.

28:10	y703	application			Why did Jesus talk to the young man about being perfect?	The young man wrongly thought he could be ‘good enough’ to have eternal life.

28:10	xni8	application			Why were the disciples so shocked to hear that it was almost impossible for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven?

38:15	kn5o	application			Why do you think the disciples did not believe that they would abandon Jesus?	The disciples thought they were brave enough to stand with Jesus.

38:15	cucp	application			What does Jesus prayer to his Father in the garden teach us about doing God’s will?	Jesus did not want to suffer and die, and asked his Father to spare him.

Therefore, he was willing to be arrested and killed.
38:15	athx	application			Why did the Jewish leaders need Judas to betray Jesus?	Jesus taught publicly every day, but the Jewish leaders were afraid to arrest him in front of the crowds who came to listen to him. They needed Judas to tell them when Jesus would be in a secluded place so they could arrest him in secret.
38:15	kdmi	application			Why do you think Peter struck the servant of the high priest with his sword?	Peter did not understand that Jesus must die for sinners. He had not listened each time Jesus told him this would happen. Therefore, he wrongly tried to save Jesus by force. But Jesus rebuked Peter and even healed the servant that Peter struck. He did not want his servants to prevent his arrest.
39:1	j4c3	meaning			Where did the soldiers first take Jesus after they arrested him?	They took him to the house of the high priest (See: [39:01](39/01)).
39:2	mffj	meaning			What did the Jewish leaders do to try and prove that Jesus was guilty?	They brought many false witnesses who lied about Jesus. However, the witnesses did not agree with each other, so they could not prove that Jesus was guilty of anything (See: [39:02](39/02)).
39:3	q27l	meaning			What question did the high priest ask Jesus, and how did Jesus answer?	The high priest asked if Jesus was the Messiah, and the Son of the living God. Jesus told the high priest that this was who he was (See: [39:03](39/03), [39:04](39/04)).
39:5	g2ik	meaning			How did the Jewish leaders react when Jesus said he was the Messiah and the Son of God?	They all became angry and shouted that Jesus deserved to die. They blindfolded him, spit on him, hit him, and mocked him (See: [39:05](39/05)).
39:7	jepb	meaning			What did Peter say when people outside the high priest’s house said he had been with Jesus?	Peter swore and said he did not know Jesus (See: [39:07](39/07)).

39:12	relk	meaning			Why did Pilate tell his soldiers to crucify Jesus?	Pilate was afraid the crowd would riot, so he ordered his soldiers to crucify Jesus in order to satisfy the crowd. Therefore, they whipped Jesus and prepared to kill him (See: [39:12](39/12)).
39:12	kljc	application			What was the only charge the high priest was able to bring against Jesus?	Jesus had not done anything wrong, so the high priest could not find true witnesses against him. Finally, he accused Jesus of pretending to be the Messiah and the Son of God. Jesus really was God’s Son, so he was not pretending. He was innocent, but the high priest would not believe him. Therefore, the whole group of religious leaders condemned Jesus.
39:12	lidb	application			How is it encouraging to followers of Jesus that Peter denied Jesus?	Peter was one of Jesus’ closest disciples. He truly believed in Jesus, and became a leader in the church. However, even Peter denied Jesus when the people accused him. No believer is perfect. Jesus does not expect us to always do the right thing. Just as Jesus loved Peter in spite of his failure, followers of Jesus know he will forgive them when they repent of their sin.
39:12	q1o2	application			Why do you think God allowed Jesus to be falsely accused and condemned?	God knows that our fallen nature causes us to sin. His Holy Spirit enables people to do his will. By dying, Jesus took the place of sinners, accepting God's judgment of sin on himself, even though he was without sin. Paying the penalty for our sin, he made it possible for God to forgive sinners. So God allowed the Jewish leaders and the Romans to convict Jesus even though they knew he was innocent. Evil actions do not stop God’s plan or his will from happening.

40:9	y7co	application			Why do you think Jesus said the soldiers did not know what they were doing?	The soldiers were Romans who did not know very much about the Jewish religion. They probably thought Jesus was an ordinary criminal, and they treated him as one.
40:9	a2fe	application			They soldiers gambled for Jesus’ clothing. Why does that help us believe Jesus was the Messiah?	This action was one of many things that the scriptures, written hundreds of years before, said they would do to the Messiah. All these prophesies were fulfilled in Jesus.
40:9	bthj	application			Jesus told the robber who repented that he would be with Jesus in Paradise that day. What does that tell us about the way to enter into heaven?	The robber did not perform a single good deed. Instead, he simply confessed that he was a sinner, and asked Jesus to remember him in the kingdom. As a result, Jesus promised that he would be in Paradise (that is, heaven) that same day. The way to enter into heaven is to believe in Jesus.
40:9	n9ji	application			Why do you think Jesus did not come down from the cross and save himself when the people asked him to?	The people who told Jesus to come down from the cross did not want to believe in him. They were only mocking him. They did not realize that he had the power to come down from the cross. But he came to earth to die for sinners. That was the will of his Father. He had to stay on the cross and give up his own life in order to make it possible for God to forgive other people who believed in Jesus.
40:9	bcq9	application			What was finished when Jesus cried out?	When Jesus cried out, “It is finished!” he wanted to say that he had finished paying the penalty for the sins of everyone in the world.

40:9	pecl	application			Why was the curtain of the Temple torn from top to bottom?	The curtain of the Temple prevented people from seeing or entering into the most holy place in the Temple where God was. God in heaven above tore the curtain from the top to the bottom when Jesus died. He did this to show that Jesus had opened a way for man to approach God through the sacrifice of Jesus.
40:9	pgyz	application			Why did the soldier say that Jesus was innocent, and the Son of God?	The Roman soldier had probably executed hundreds of criminals. He recognized that Jesus did not act like a criminal. Instead, he was a good man who asked his Father to forgive the soldiers, and who spoke kindly to the robber who repented. Furthermore, the miraculous signs that happened when Jesus died convinced the soldier that Jesus was not just a man—he was the Son of God.
41:1	rfb2	meaning			What were the Jewish leaders afraid the disciples would do with the body of Jesus?	They were afraid the disciples would steal Jesus’ body and say he had risen from the dead (See: [41:01](41/01)).

41:8	bp9n	application			Who was it that remembered Jesus’ promise to rise from the dead in three days?	It is surprising that the disciples did not remember the Jesus said he would rise from the dead in three days. Instead, it was the unbelieving Jewish leaders who remembered what he said. They did not believe him, but they did remember his words. The disciples should have remembered.
41:8	ee23	application			Were the soldiers able to prevent the tomb from opening?	The Roman soldiers were the best soldiers of that time. However, they could not stand against the single angel that God sent to open the tomb. The strongest military force could not stop God from doing what he planned to do. When the angel appeared, they fell down like dead men.
41:8	xeex	application			How did the angel treat the women who came to the tomb?	The angel knew that the women had come to honor Jesus by putting spices on his body. Therefore, the angel spoke kindly to them and told them not to be afraid. He showed them the empty tomb, and told them that Jesus would meet them in Galilee.
41:8	ul9s	application			Why do you think Jesus met the women, when he told them the same thing as the angel?	Jesus did not need to appear to the women. The angel had already told them that he was alive and would meet the disciples in Galilee. But Jesus also knew that the women had come to honor him. Perhaps he appears to them for that reason, so he could honor them for coming to serve him. The women were therefore the first people to see Jesus after he became alive again.
42:1	evqi	meaning			What were the two disciples talking about as they went to a nearby town?	They were talking about what had happened to Jesus. The women had said Jesus was alive, so they did not know what to believe (See: [42:01](42/01)).

42:11	z0vv	application			Why do you think the two disciples on the road did not believe that Jesus had risen from the dead?	They had thought Jesus was the Messiah, so it was very difficult and discouraging for them when he died. Perhaps they did not want to believe the report from the women so that they would not be disappointed again if Jesus was not really alive.
42:11	dnav	application			Why do you think the two disciples did not recognize Jesus?	It seems as if Jesus prevented the two disciples from recognizing him. Perhaps he wanted them to believe the things the prophets had written about him in God’s word before he revealed himself to them. From the time Jesus went back to heaven, people have not been able to see him, and must believe in him because of what God’s word says about him.
42:11	ykyt	application			Why did the disciples in Jerusalem not believe Jesus was alive when he first appeared to them?	Jesus had told the disciples that he would become alive again after three days. The woman had also seen him alive at the tomb and told the disciples. And the two disciples who saw Jesus on the road told them that Jesus was alive. Even so, when Jesus appeared among them in the room, they thought he was a ghost. It is amazing that they did not believe he was alive even with so much proof. They only understood clearly after Jesus explained to them the things written about him in God’s word.
42:11	iryw	application			What must people do in order for God to forgive them?	People must repent in order for God to forgive them.

43:13	m4n8	application			What was the main thing the believers continually did when they gathered together?	Prayer was very important to the believers. They continually gathered together to pray to God as a group, in addition to praying individually. Perhaps that is why God did such powerful works among them.
43:13	vrnt	application			How did the gift of speaking in other languages help the believers proclaim the message of Jesus?	The people in Jerusalem knew the believers could not speak the native languages of everyone in the crowd. When they heard and saw them do this, they knew it was a miracle.

They could also speak to any person from any language group about Jesus, and that person would understand completely what they said.
43:13	dhs7	application			What did Peter tell the crowd about Jesus?	Peter told them that they had crucified Jesus, but that God had raised him from the dead just as the prophets had said he would.

43:13	uxw6	application			How did people respond to Peter’s message?	God caused the people to be deeply moved so that they asked Peter what they should do. God will not always cause people to respond in this way, but on that occasion, 3,000 people believed the message and repented.

45:12	w4i5	application			When Philip approached the Ethiopian, how was it exactly the right time for the Ethiopian to hear about Jesus?	The Ethiopian was reading about the Messiah in the book of the prophet Isaiah, but did not know that Isaiah was writing about Jesus.

46:10	w51o	application			Why do you think Jesus told Saul that he was persecuting Jesus?	Jesus was already in heaven when Saul began to persecute the believers.

46:10	bhhf	application			Who went to Antioch to teach the new believers there?	The two people who went to teach the believers at Antioch were Barnabas and Saul.

46:10	xe6e	application			How did the Holy Spirit send out Barnabas and Saul?	The Holy Spirit spoke to the believers in the church at Antioch in order to send out Barnabas and Saul. The church then prayed for them, placed their hands on them, and supported them as they went out to preach among the other people groups. God did not send them out alone. Instead, he worked through the church so the believers were deeply involved in the work of Barnabas and Saul.

47:9	nkcx	meaning			What happened when the earthquake shook the jail during the night?	All the prison doors opened wide, and the chains of all the prisoners fell off. As a result, the jailer thought the prisoners had escaped, and planned to kill himself (See: [47:09](47/09), [47:10](47/10)).

47:13	zdrw	application			Why did Paul and Silas go to the river in Philippi?	When Paul and Silas arrived in Philippi, they looked for a place where people would be willing to hear about Jesus. They went to the river because that was the place where people went to pray to God.

She knew about God, but she did not know about Jesus. When Paul and Silas told her about Jesus, she believed in him and was baptized. It is not enough for a person to believe in God. They must also believe in Jesus, whom God sent, in order to be saved from their sins.
47:13	tiwg	application			Why was Paul so annoyed by the demon that was speaking the truth about Paul and Silas?	Demons are evil, and the enemies of God. Therefore, Paul was not willing to have them speak about God—even if what they said at that time was true. There can be no friendship between demons and the servants of God.
47:13	exms	application			What were Paul and Silas doing in the middle of the night while they were in jail?

They trusted God completely, and were able to praise him in the most difficult situations.

47:13	ur8k	application			To whom did Paul write the letters that became books of the Bible?	Paul wrote all of his letters to the believers in the churches of that time.

48:13	e9cn	application			Why is there evil, suffering, and death in the world?	People do evil things, suffer, and die because Adam and Eve sinned against God. They became sinners because of that, and so did all of their descendants. As a result, every person in the world is a sinner.
