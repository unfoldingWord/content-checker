front:intro	gtn1				# Titus Study Questions\n\nThe Apostle Paul left Titus in Crete and gave him the responsibility to teach the new believers there, and to appoint elders in the local churches. Titus was a godly man, but he was not have as much experience as Paul did in guiding the formation of the new churches. In this letter, therefore, Paul counsels Titus concerning:\n\n* How Titus should fulfil his task\n* The kind of men he should appoint as elders\n* The type of threats that existed that could damage the new believers\n* How believers should act in their daily lifes\n* What is the hope that the believers look forward to\n* How believers should interact with secular authorities and those who do not believe in Jesus\n* The precise message that we should believe and teach\n* How to deal with division within the church\n\nYou can discover Paul’s teaching concerning each of these things by carefully reading each chapter of the letter. Ask yourself questions about what you read, and pray to God that he will open your eyes to see clearly.
